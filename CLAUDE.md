## Stock-Specific News Connectors

Use this guidance when adding connectors that support stock/ticker-specific news, market commentary, or "stocks getting attention" workflows.

### Feasibility By Source

- RSS, blogs, newsletters: high feasibility. Prefer RSS/Atom feeds and normal article extraction. This matches the existing `trade_media_scraper.py`, `wsj_rss_scraper.py`, and `substack_public_scraper.py` patterns.
- Public Substack posts: high feasibility for public posts. Prefer publication `/feed` URLs and public post extraction. Do not attempt to bypass paid/private posts; mark them as access-limited and preserve metadata/preview only when available.
- Reddit: medium feasibility. Prefer OAuth/PRAW for reliable access. The existing `reddit_scraper.py` supports this shape. Treat commercial use as requiring Reddit API compliance review/permission, and expect unauthenticated JSON access to fail from cloud IPs.
- X/Twitter: medium feasibility but potentially costly. Use official X API v2 for recent search, user timelines, and streams. Do not scrape X pages. Add strict budget caps, source allowlists, and rate-limit handling before enabling production jobs.
- YouTube: medium feasibility. Use the YouTube Data API for channel/video discovery, metadata, comments, and stats. Treat transcripts/captions as conditional on availability and authorization.
- Telegram: medium/low feasibility. Bot API works for channels where the bot is authorized and receives channel posts. Do not assume arbitrary public-channel history can be ingested reliably.
- TradingView: low feasibility for ingestion. TradingView widgets are display tools, not a market-data export API. For prices, candles, fundamentals, or indicators, use licensed market-data providers instead.

### Preferred Architecture

Build stock-news ingestion as connector modules feeding a normalized schema, not as a single scraper.

Core records should include:

- `sources`: platform, handle/url, source owner, access mode, priority, compliance status.
- `raw_items`: platform id, source id, author, published timestamp, canonical URL, raw text/metadata, engagement metrics, fetched timestamp.
- `mentions`: raw item id, ticker/entity, confidence, context snippet.
- `daily_stock_attention`: ticker, mention count, weighted score, mood, source count, top source ids.
- `analyst_profiles`: curated identity, handles, channels, notes, credibility metadata.
- `daily_briefs`: generated summaries with source citations.

Pipeline order:

1. Ingest new posts/articles from each connector.
2. Normalize records into one internal schema.
3. Deduplicate by platform id, canonical URL, and content hash.
4. Extract tickers, cashtags, companies, sectors, and themes.
5. Classify mood as bullish, bearish, mixed, neutral, or informational.
6. Aggregate "stocks getting attention" using mention count, source diversity, source weight, freshness decay, and engagement.
7. Generate source-backed daily briefs with links/citations to originals.
8. Label output as research context only, not investment advice.

### Implementation Order

Start with sources that are legally and operationally stable:

1. Expand RSS/blog/Substack connectors.
2. Add Reddit OAuth/PRAW configuration and commercial-use checks.
3. Add X API connector with explicit budget controls and curated handles.
4. Add ticker/entity extraction and mood aggregation.
5. Add daily brief generation and source-backed UI surfaces.

Avoid starting with Telegram history or TradingView data ingestion. Those should only be added after the reliable source pipeline is working and the access model is clear.

### Compliance Defaults

- Prefer official APIs and public RSS feeds over page scraping.
- Preserve canonical URLs and source attribution for every item.
- Do not bypass paywalls, login walls, CAPTCHAs, private groups, or anti-bot controls.
- Store enough raw metadata to audit why a ticker appeared in a summary.
- Separate source-backed facts from model-generated summaries.
- Add per-connector rate limits, retries, and failure reporting before production scheduling.

        "full_text": "Good afternoon. Thank you to the Government Finance Officers Association (“GFOA”) for inviting me to speak with you today. In my role as the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“Commission” or “SEC”) Director of the Office of Municipal Securities (“Office of Municipal Securities” or “OMS”), I get a front row seat to see how government finance professionals strive to advance the continued integrity of the municipal securities market. However, I also get a front row seat to some concerning behaviors that may impact the investor confidence and transparency of the municipal securities market. As is customary, I must remind you that this speech is provided in my official capacity as the Commission’s Director of the Office of Municipal Securities but does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.\n\n**I. What’s in a Title?**\n\nBefore I delve into disclosure practices, I would like to start by offering my views on another area of concern to which OMS is paying careful attention. It’s been fifteen years since Congress created a new class of regulated person required to register with the Commission: municipal advisors. [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn1 \"\") But when I speak with market participants or pick up an official statement or visit an issuer’s website, I am regularly confronted with a title that imprecisely [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn2 \"\") reflects the nature of the relationship between municipal entities and/or obligated persons and their advisors: financial advisor. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn3 \"\") While some of you may view using the terms “financial advisor” and “municipal advisor” to be interchangeable when discussing hiring a professional to negotiate terms of a transaction or verify pricing as just a matter of a title, Congress expressly defined those persons who engage in municipal advisory activities [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn4 \"\") as “municipal advisors”. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn5 \"\") I’m going to start with why I think it’s helpful to use regulatory terms. Although not required, using regulatory terms such as “municipal advisor” in solicitations and offering documents is helpful because it clearly indicates to investors that those professionals are subject to the rules and regulations designed to protect investors and municipal entities [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn6 \"\") and obligated persons. [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn7 \"\") Additionally, using defined regulatory terms in these documents may be helpful to municipal entities and obligated persons in avoiding including confusing or ambiguous statements in disclosures to investors. Now, for the what. Let’s start with hiring professionals. Municipal entities and obligated persons often retain various professionals through a competitive request for proposal/qualification (“RFP/Q”) process. Before anyone objects, you’re correct: responses to RFP/Qs do not on their own constitute municipal advisory activity. [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn8 \"\") I have, however, observed instances (most notably in public-private partnerships [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn9 \"\") and charter schools [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn10 \"\")) where the work or services requested in the RFP/Qs would require the selected professional to be registered as a municipal advisor because they would be providing advice with respect to the issuance of municipal securities or the use of municipal financial products. In our review of these RFP/Qs, we have either seen municipal entities be silent on requiring that respondents to an RFP/Q be registered as a municipal advisor with the Commission and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) or, worse, affirmatively say that registration as a municipal advisor is not a requirement. [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn11 \"\") Given that unregistered entities may be engaging in what appears to be municipal advisory activity, you may want to confirm not only that any professional providing municipal advisory services to you is properly registered [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn12 \"\") but also that you have in your RFP/Qs for services or work constituting municipal advisory activity a requirement that respondents be registered with the Commission and the MSRB as municipal advisors in order to submit a response. At a minimum, I do not believe these RFP/Qs should be soliciting the services of a “financial advisor” or “consultant” which may create the impression that they do not need to be registered with the Commission or the MSRB. If you are seeking the services of a municipal advisor, it would be helpful to use the term municipal advisor in your RFP/Qs. Another area where I see a concerning use of “financial advisor,” where “municipal advisor” should be used, is in your offering documents. As previously mentioned, municipal advisor is more than just a title: it is a regulatory term. Using “municipal advisor” tells investors that the firm, its associated persons, and its activities are subject to rules and regulations; that the Commission monitors municipal advisors for compliance; and takes necessary action to enforce Congress’s mandate. If you use municipal advisors in your transactions, I think it would be beneficial to use the defined term “municipal advisor” in your offering documents to accurately describe the professionals fulfilling that role. Using a term that is explicitly defined by law may also help avoid including confusing or ambiguous statements in disclosures to investors. There are also strong benefits to being involved with or retaining persons or firms registered and regulated as municipal advisers, as it demonstrates that these persons or firms recognize that they are engaging in municipal advisory activity. Registering as a municipal advisor may also demonstrate that the advisor understands that it has certain legal obligations, including a requirement to register unless an exclusion or exemption applies. These obligations include, among other things, a requirement to disclose to clients any material conflicts of interest. If you remember nothing else from today, remember this: your municipal advisor is required to always act in your best interest.\n\n**II. Observations on Amendments to Continuing Disclosure Undertakings**\n\nNow turning to disclosure practices. When the Commission proposed amendments [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn13 \"\") to Rule 15c2-12 (“Rule 15c2-12” or “Rule”) [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn14 \"\") of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) in 1994 [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn15 \"\") prohibiting underwriters, subject to certain exemptions, from purchasing or selling municipal securities covered by the Rule in a primary offering, unless the underwriter had reasonably determined that the issuer (or obligated person) had undertaken in a written agreement or contract [\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn16 \"\") (“continuing disclosure undertaking”) to provide specified annual information and event notices, [\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn17 \"\") practitioners expressed concern [\\[18\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn18 \"\") that the amendments were not sufficiently flexible to address changing conditions to financial and pertinent operating information. The Commission addressed practitioners’ concerns when it adopted the amendments. [\\[19\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn19 \"\")\n\n**a. NABL 1 Letter**\n\nThe Commission explained in the 1994 Amendments Adopting Release that Rule 15c2-12, as amended, requires that continuing disclosure undertakings specify only the general type of information to be provided [\\[20\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn20 \"\") and that undertakings should be drafted with sufficient flexibility to accommodate for subsequent developments that may require adjustments in the financial information and operating data contractually agreed upon in the undertaking. [\\[21\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn21 \"\") Shortly after adoption of the amendments, the National Association of Bond Lawyers (“NABL”) requested [\\[22\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn22 \"\") staff guidance interpreting an issue that I see continues to be debated thirty-one years later: amending continuing disclosure undertakings. Let’s take a moment and revisit the statements made by staff on amending continuing disclosure undertakings in response to the NABL 1 Letter. [\\[23\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn23 \"\") Staff first noted that in meeting the requirement that annual financial information be specified in reasonable detail, staff anticipated that continuing disclosure undertakings would set forth a general description of the type of financial information and operating data that would be provided. Staff further observed that these descriptions would not need to state more than a general category of financial information and operating data. Moreover, staff noted that where a continuing disclosure undertaking calls for information that no longer can be generated because the operations to which it related had been materially changed or discontinued, a statement to that effect would satisfy the continuing disclosure undertaking. In such instances, staff explained that it may be good practice to provide similar operating data with respect to any substitute or replacement operation. Further, staff noted that issuers and obligated persons may provide additional information that is not required by the terms of the undertaking. Accordingly, the staff did not anticipate that it often would be necessary to amend informational undertakings. In addition to providing guidance on the circumstances under which an undertaking could be amended, the staff also provided several examples [\\[24\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn24 \"\") of annual financial information descriptions. For example, categories of operating data provided for a college or university facility bond offering might include, among others, information regarding attendance, applications, and tuition and room and board rates charged to students. In a water or sewer financing, categories of information provided might include, among others, customers, rates, use, capacity, and demand.\n\n**b. Current State of Continuing Disclosure Undertakings**\n\nNow I would like to take the opportunity to reflect on the current state of continuing disclosure undertakings. Since the 1994 amendments promoted flexibility in drafting continuing disclosure undertakings, staff has heard that practitioners have discovered ambiguities and inconsistencies in their continuing disclosure undertakings that have resulted in overlapping, inconsistent, and outdated information in required disclosures. Consequently, practitioners continue to struggle with questions about amending continuing disclosure undertakings and have asked the staff for guidance on this issue. To start, I want to remind practitioners that Rule 15c2-12, as amended, offers flexibility in the content and scope of disclosed financial information. [\\[25\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn25 \"\") The Rule specifies only general types of information relating to the financial information and operating data to accommodate for any subsequent developments that would require adjustments to the data. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn26 \"\") Further, adhering to your continuing disclosure undertakings does not preclude you from providing additional information, particularly where disclosure may be necessary to avoid liability under the antifraud provisions. [\\[27\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn27 \"\") The staff recognizes that, despite the staff interpretive guidance in the NABL 1 Letter, which elaborated on statements in the 1994 Amendments Adopting Release, some obligated persons have continued to provide specific and relatively unflexible descriptions of annual financial information or operating data in the continuing disclosure undertakings by, for instance, pointing to specific tables of information in an official statement because they believe it makes it easier for issuers and dissemination agents to comply with the undertaking. Although Rule 15c2-12 does not prohibit such specificity or incorporation by reference, [\\[28\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn28 \"\") I believe that where obligated persons choose to include references to specific tables or similar specificity, they might consider including language allowing for flexibility, such as describing tables “of the type” or tables “of the kind” provided in the official statement. The inclusion in continuing disclosure undertakings of clear descriptions of the disclosures to be made by municipal issuers and obligated persons promotes a more transparent and efficient market. However, drafters of continuing disclosure undertakings may want to be mindful when specifying the particular types of information that will be provided for many years into the future, as continuing disclosure undertakings are contractual obligations that cannot be amended based on a unilateral decision by an issuer or any other party. With very limited exceptions, issuers and obligated persons may not later decide unilaterally what types of information an investor would consider necessary or meaningful, especially where such information has previously been agreed upon. [\\[29\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn29 \"\") Continuing disclosure undertakings would be meaningless if issuers and obligated persons could unilaterally determine that certain types of information were no longer necessary or meaningful to investors. [\\[30\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn30 \"\") Despite previous requests from the market for guidance on amending continuing disclosure agreements, I remind you that those agreements are contracts governed by state law [\\[31\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn31 \"\") from which the Commission does not have the authority to provide exemptions. Failure to comply with continuing disclosure undertakings would be breaches of contract enforceable by private parties. [\\[32\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn32 \"\") This is why staff statements have focused on using language in continuing disclosure agreements that allow for changing conditions.\n\n**III. The Importance of Voluntary Disclosure in the Municipal Securities Market**\n\nSound, timely, and accurate disclosures of the financial condition and operating status of issuers and obligated persons promotes the continued integrity of the municipal securities market. [\\[33\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn33 \"\") As we all know, Rule 15c2-12 requires that continuing disclosure undertakings set forth certain enumerated requirements. Rule 15c2-12 does not generally impose an obligation to provide ongoing information beyond the contractual continuing disclosure obligations. I am of the view, however, that voluntary disclosures [\\[34\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn34 \"\") — providing information beyond contractual continuing disclosure obligations — by issuers and obligated persons can provide market participants with updated financial and other disclosures regarding the effects of evolving economic conditions. [\\[35\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn35 \"\")\n\n**a. Improving Transparency and Market Efficiencies**\n\nIssuer organizations and other market participants have noted that providing voluntary interim disclosure can serve the interests of municipal issuers and have developed voluntary disclosure best practices designed to improve the quality and quantity of voluntary disclosure in the secondary market. [\\[36\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn36 \"\") GFOA issued a Best Practices on Voluntary Disclosure in 2021. [\\[37\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn37 \"\") I am of the view that if issuers and obligated persons provide voluntary disclosures of their financial condition and operating status on a more frequent basis, the additional information could potentially reduce information asymmetries and help investors and other market participants identify early warning signs of an issuer’s or obligated person’s deteriorating financial condition sooner (such as budget deficits and imbalances, high unfunded pensions liability, and decreases in property value), which could lead to increased market efficiencies. Some examples of helpful voluntary disclosures that municipal issuers and obligated persons could consider disseminating are [\\[38\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn38 \"\")\n\n- More Timely Financial Information. Municipal issuers routinely prepare periodic reports containing financial information and/or operating data, such as investment positions, interim financial information, or capital improvement plans, for various non-disclosure purposes, [\\[39\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn39 \"\") which are generally produced in accordance with governance documents, best practices, and generally accepted guidelines. Municipal issuers could consider submitting such reports via the repository designated by the Commission (currently the MSRB’s Electronic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) system) and/or through their own designated website.\n\n- Reports Prepared for Other Governmental Purposes. Municipal issuers and obligated persons may have prepared reports addressing relevant climate, cybersecurity, litigation, or other risks for other purposes.\n\n- Reports and Information Shared with Third Parties. Reports prepared to be shared with rating agencies, bank loan providers or other market participants may also include information material to investors. [\\[40\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn40 \"\")\n\n- Information Regarding Availability of Federal, State and Local Aid. If it materially affects, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, your ability to repay debt service, you could make available a description of available aid that you have sought or are planning on seeking and any other material terms of the aid to investors.\n\n- Information Regarding Non-Routine Events that May Impact an Issuer’s Ability to Repay Securities. For instance, a large business relocating to your jurisdiction may have a positive impact, while a natural disaster may have a negative impact. Sharing information with the market on any non-routine events that may impact your ability to repay debt service could be helpful.\n\nIn my view, making any voluntary disclosures available in the place or places where they regularly make information available to investors, such as on the EMMA system and/or on their own websites, would be helpful to both issuers and investors.\n\n**b. Observations on Liability**\n\nI sometimes hear from issuers that they would disclose more information to the market, but that their counsel advises them, as a matter of course, not to provide any information that is not required. I recognize that the issue of liability is often raised in connection with voluntary disclosures. I believe that accompanying voluntary disclosures that contain projections or forward-looking statements with meaningful cautionary language — including, for example, (1) a description of relevant facts or assumptions affecting the reasonableness of reliance on and the materiality of the information provided, (2) a description of how certain important information may be incomplete or unknown, and (3) the process or methodology (audited versus unaudited) used by the municipal issuer or obligated person to produce the information — could not only improve the quality of the disclosure but also help mitigate associated legal risks. As I observe the municipal securities market and consider appropriate paths to address behaviors that impact investor confidence and transparency, I believe that it would be beneficial for municipal issuers to disclose, to exercise reasonable care, and to follow best practices in the creation and release of any voluntary disclosure. It’s always a pleasure to speak with members of the GFOA. Thank you again for the invitation to discuss these important issues with you today.\n\n* * *\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_ednref1 \"\")           See Section 975(a)(1)(B) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(1)(B)) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act” or “Dodd-Frank”).\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_ednref2 \"\")           See Speech, Dave A.

In the event a state statute or other governing document references “financial advisor” or other term, it may be appropriate to use both terms with appropriate definitions and cross-references.\n\n[\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_ednref4 \"\")           Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15Ba1-1(e) (15 CFR 240.15Ba1-1(e)), “municipal advisory activities” includes, but is not limited to, “\\[p\\]roviding advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, including advice with respect to the structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning such financial products or issue.”\n\n[\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_ednref5 \"\")           See Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(A) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(A)). The definition of municipal advisor includes financial advisors, guaranteed investment contract brokers, third-party marketers, placement agents, solicitors, finders, and swap advisors that provide municipal advisory services, unless they are statutorily excluded. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(B). The statutory definition of municipal advisor excludes a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer serving as an underwriter (as defined in section 77b(a)(11) of this title), any investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et seq.), or persons associated with such investment advisers who are providing investment advice, any commodity trading advisor registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or persons associated with a commodity trading advisor who are providing advice related to swaps, attorneys offering legal advice or providing services that are of a traditional legal nature, or engineers providing engineering advice.

Although not required, using regulatory terms such as “municipal advisor” in solicitations and offering documents is helpful because it clearly indicates to investors that those professionals are subject to the rules and regulations designed to protect investors and municipal entities [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn6 \"\") and obligated persons. [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn7 \"\") Additionally, using defined regulatory terms in these documents may be helpful to municipal entities and obligated persons in avoiding including confusing or ambiguous statements in disclosures to investors. Now, for the what. Let’s start with hiring professionals. Municipal entities and obligated persons often retain various professionals through a competitive request for proposal/qualification (“RFP/Q”) process. Before anyone objects, you’re correct: responses to RFP/Qs do not on their own constitute municipal advisory activity. [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn8 \"\") I have, however, observed instances (most notably in public-private partnerships [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn9 \"\") and charter schools [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn10 \"\")) where the work or services requested in the RFP/Qs would require the selected professional to be registered as a municipal advisor because they would be providing advice with respect to the issuance of municipal securities or the use of municipal financial products. In our review of these RFP/Qs, we have either seen municipal entities be silent on requiring that respondents to an RFP/Q be registered as a municipal advisor with the Commission and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) or, worse, affirmatively say that registration as a municipal advisor is not a requirement. [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn11 \"\") Given that unregistered entities may be engaging in what appears to be municipal advisory activity, you may want to confirm not only that any professional providing municipal advisory services to you is properly registered [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn12 \"\") but also that you have in your RFP/Qs for services or work constituting municipal advisory activity a requirement that respondents be registered with the Commission and the MSRB as municipal advisors in order to submit a response. At a minimum, I do not believe these RFP/Qs should be soliciting the services of a “financial advisor” or “consultant” which may create the impression that they do not need to be registered with the Commission or the MSRB. If you are seeking the services of a municipal advisor, it would be helpful to use the term municipal advisor in your RFP/Qs. Another area where I see a concerning use of “financial advisor,” where “municipal advisor” should be used, is in your offering documents. As previously mentioned, municipal advisor is more than just a title: it is a regulatory term. Using “municipal advisor” tells investors that the firm, its associated persons, and its activities are subject to rules and regulations; that the Commission monitors municipal advisors for compliance; and takes necessary action to enforce Congress’s mandate. If you use municipal advisors in your transactions, I think it would be beneficial to use the defined term “municipal advisor” in your offering documents to accurately describe the professionals fulfilling that role. Using a term that is explicitly defined by law may also help avoid including confusing or ambiguous statements in disclosures to investors. There are also strong benefits to being involved with or retaining persons or firms registered and regulated as municipal advisers, as it demonstrates that these persons or firms recognize that they are engaging in municipal advisory activity. Registering as a municipal advisor may also demonstrate that the advisor understands that it has certain legal obligations, including a requirement to register unless an exclusion or exemption applies. These obligations include, among other things, a requirement to disclose to clients any material conflicts of interest. If you remember nothing else from today, remember this: your municipal advisor is required to always act in your best interest.",

Staff further observed that these descriptions would not need to state more than a general category of financial information and operating data. Moreover, staff noted that where a continuing disclosure undertaking calls for information that no longer can be generated because the operations to which it related had been materially changed or discontinued, a statement to that effect would satisfy the continuing disclosure undertaking. In such instances, staff explained that it may be good practice to provide similar operating data with respect to any substitute or replacement operation. Further, staff noted that issuers and obligated persons may provide additional information that is not required by the terms of the undertaking. Accordingly, the staff did not anticipate that it often would be necessary to amend informational undertakings. In addition to providing guidance on the circumstances under which an undertaking could be amended, the staff also provided several examples [\\[24\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn24 \"\") of annual financial information descriptions. For example, categories of operating data provided for a college or university facility bond offering might include, among others, information regarding attendance, applications, and tuition and room and board rates charged to students. In a water or sewer financing, categories of information provided might include, among others, customers, rates, use, capacity, and demand.",
          "**b. Current State of Continuing Disclosure Undertakings**",
          "Now I would like to take the opportunity to reflect on the current state of continuing disclosure undertakings. Since the 1994 amendments promoted flexibility in drafting continuing disclosure undertakings, staff has heard that practitioners have discovered ambiguities and inconsistencies in their continuing disclosure undertakings that have resulted in overlapping, inconsistent, and outdated information in required disclosures. Consequently, practitioners continue to struggle with questions about amending continuing disclosure undertakings and have asked the staff for guidance on this issue. To start, I want to remind practitioners that Rule 15c2-12, as amended, offers flexibility in the content and scope of disclosed financial information. [\\[25\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn25 \"\") The Rule specifies only general types of information relating to the financial information and operating data to accommodate for any subsequent developments that would require adjustments to the data. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn26 \"\") Further, adhering to your continuing disclosure undertakings does not preclude you from providing additional information, particularly where disclosure may be necessary to avoid liability under the antifraud provisions. [\\[27\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn27 \"\") The staff recognizes that, despite the staff interpretive guidance in the NABL 1 Letter, which elaborated on statements in the 1994 Amendments Adopting Release, some obligated persons have continued to provide specific and relatively unflexible descriptions of annual financial information or operating data in the continuing disclosure undertakings by, for instance, pointing to specific tables of information in an official statement because they believe it makes it easier for issuers and dissemination agents to comply with the undertaking. Although Rule 15c2-12 does not prohibit such specificity or incorporation by reference, [\\[28\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn28 \"\") I believe that where obligated persons choose to include references to specific tables or similar specificity, they might consider including language allowing for flexibility, such as describing tables “of the type” or tables “of the kind” provided in the official statement. The inclusion in continuing disclosure undertakings of clear descriptions of the disclosures to be made by municipal issuers and obligated persons promotes a more transparent and efficient market. However, drafters of continuing disclosure undertakings may want to be mindful when specifying the particular types of information that will be provided for many years into the future, as continuing disclosure undertakings are contractual obligations that cannot be amended based on a unilateral decision by an issuer or any other party. With very limited exceptions, issuers and obligated persons may not later decide unilaterally what types of information an investor would consider necessary or meaningful, especially where such information has previously been agreed upon. [\\[29\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn29 \"\") Continuing disclosure undertakings would be meaningless if issuers and obligated persons could unilaterally determine that certain types of information were no longer necessary or meaningful to investors.

I believe that accompanying voluntary disclosures that contain projections or forward-looking statements with meaningful cautionary language — including, for example, (1) a description of relevant facts or assumptions affecting the reasonableness of reliance on and the materiality of the information provided, (2) a description of how certain important information may be incomplete or unknown, and (3) the process or methodology (audited versus unaudited) used by the municipal issuer or obligated person to produce the information — could not only improve the quality of the disclosure but also help mitigate associated legal risks. As I observe the municipal securities market and consider appropriate paths to address behaviors that impact investor confidence and transparency, I believe that it would be beneficial for municipal issuers to disclose, to exercise reasonable care, and to follow best practices in the creation and release of any voluntary disclosure.

          "Moreover, staff noted that where a continuing disclosure undertaking calls for information that no longer can be generated because the operations to which it related had been materially changed or discontinued, a statement to that effect would satisfy the continuing disclosure undertaking",
          "In such instances, staff explained that it may be good practice to provide similar operating data with respect to any substitute or replacement operation",
          "Further, staff noted that issuers and obligated persons may provide additional information that is not required by the terms of the undertaking",
          "Accordingly, the staff did not anticipate that it often would be necessary to amend informational undertakings",
          "In addition to providing guidance on the circumstances under which an undertaking could be amended, the staff also provided several examples [\\[24\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn24 \"\") of annual financial information descriptions",

          "Since the 1994 amendments promoted flexibility in drafting continuing disclosure undertakings, staff has heard that practitioners have discovered ambiguities and inconsistencies in their continuing disclosure undertakings that have resulted in overlapping, inconsistent, and outdated information in required disclosures",
          "Consequently, practitioners continue to struggle with questions about amending continuing disclosure undertakings and have asked the staff for guidance on this issue",
          "To start, I want to remind practitioners that Rule 15c2-12, as amended, offers flexibility in the content and scope of disclosed financial information",

          "Although Rule 15c2-12 does not prohibit such specificity or incorporation by reference, [\\[28\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn28 \"\") I believe that where obligated persons choose to include references to specific tables or similar specificity, they might consider including language allowing for flexibility, such as describing tables “of the type” or tables “of the kind” provided in the official statement",
          "The inclusion in continuing disclosure undertakings of clear descriptions of the disclosures to be made by municipal issuers and obligated persons promotes a more transparent and efficient market",
          "However, drafters of continuing disclosure undertakings may want to be mindful when specifying the particular types of information that will be provided for many years into the future, as continuing disclosure undertakings are contractual obligations that cannot be amended based on a unilateral decision by an issuer or any other party",
          "With very limited exceptions, issuers and obligated persons may not later decide unilaterally what types of information an investor would consider necessary or meaningful, especially where such information has previously been agreed upon",
          "[\\[29\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/sanchez-speech-gfoa-06302025-issues-revisited-titles-amendments-rule-15c2-12-undertakings-voluntary-disclosure#_edn29 \"\") Continuing disclosure undertakings would be meaningless if issuers and obligated persons could unilaterally determine that certain types of information were no longer necessary or meaningful to investors",

          "Improving Transparency and Market Efficiencies**\n\nIssuer organizations and other market participants have noted that providing voluntary interim disclosure can serve the interests of municipal issuers and have developed voluntary disclosure best practices designed to improve the quality and quantity of voluntary disclosure in the secondary market",

          "Municipal issuers could consider submitting such reports via the repository designated by the Commission (currently the MSRB’s Electronic Municipal Market Access (“EMMA”) system) and/or through their own designated website",
          "- Reports Prepared for Other Governmental Purposes",
          "Municipal issuers and obligated persons may have prepared reports addressing relevant climate, cybersecurity, litigation, or other risks for other purposes",

          "- Information Regarding Non-Routine Events that May Impact an Issuer’s Ability to Repay Securities",
          "For instance, a large business relocating to your jurisdiction may have a positive impact, while a natural disaster may have a negative impact",
          "Sharing information with the market on any non-routine events that may impact your ability to repay debt service could be helpful",
          "In my view, making any voluntary disclosures available in the place or places where they regularly make information available to investors, such as on the EMMA system and/or on their own websites, would be helpful to both issuers and investors",
          "Observations on Liability**\n\nI sometimes hear from issuers that they would disclose more information to the market, but that their counsel advises them, as a matter of course, not to provide any information that is not required",
          "I recognize that the issue of liability is often raised in connection with voluntary disclosures",
          "I believe that accompanying voluntary disclosures that contain projections or forward-looking statements with meaningful cautionary language — including, for example, (1) a description of relevant facts or assumptions affecting the reasonableness of reliance on and the materiality of the information provided, (2) a description of how certain important information may be incomplete or unknown, and (3) the process or methodology (audited versus unaudited) used by the municipal issuer or obligated person to produce the information — could not only improve the quality of the disclosure but also help mitigate associated legal risks",
          "As I observe the municipal securities market and consider appropriate paths to address behaviors that impact investor confidence and transparency, I believe that it would be beneficial for municipal issuers to disclose, to exercise reasonable care, and to follow best practices in the creation and release of any voluntary disclosure",

        "full_text": "Good afternoon. Thank you, Norm, for your kind introduction and the invitation to be here. It gives me great pleasure to be with you all, particularly at what I believe is a defining moment for American leadership in the crypto asset markets. Before I share a few reflections, I want to thank the America First Policy Institute for convening such a timely conversation. And, I must note, in order to keep my compliance folks happy, that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\n\nToday, I would like to discuss what Commissioner Hester Peirce and I are calling “Project Crypto,” which will be the SEC’s north star in aiding President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn1) But before I discuss our plan for crypto market primacy, let me take a few moments to revisit some inflection points in the history of our financial markets that bear similarities to the one we are at now, so that the future we shape is worthy of the legacy that we inherit. ## Evolution of Capital Markets: From Buttonwood to Blockchain The winds of innovation have always swept through our capital markets, often at gale force. In 1792, they rustled the leaves of a buttonwood tree, beneath which two dozen stockbrokers assembled to establish the forerunner to the New York Stock Exchange. That modest agreement—fewer than a hundred words handwritten on a slip of parchment—set in motion an elegant design that would govern the flow of capital for generations. [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn2) In the centuries since, our markets have never stood still. They have expanded, evolved, and reinvented themselves in step with the ideas and technologies of their time. Markets are dynamic because of the people who participate in them. Markets channel human ingenuity toward society’s most intractable problems by rewarding those who develop the most innovative solutions that others value enough to buy. They are the mechanism by which Adam Smith’s invisible hand elevates those who act in the common good—even when pursuing their own. The SEC’s role is to safeguard markets that allow the spark of human creativity and skill to benefit society. Over the arc of its history, the agency has both enabled innovation and, regrettably at times, stifled it. Fortunately, progress has a way of prevailing. And when our regulatory posture is calibrated to meet innovation with thoughtfulness rather than fear, America’s leadership position has only grown stronger. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\n\nIn the 1960s—before my time, I am happy to say—Wall Street was riding a bull market. But behind the scenes, our market machinery was straining to keep up. Most clearing and settlement transactions involved a costly and cumbersome process. Rising stacks of paper stock certificates had to be physically delivered by clerks wheeling carts up and down Wall Street and in other financial districts all across America. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn3) It was a scene from another century struggling to meet the demands of the modern securities markets. Indeed, the paper-based clearance and settlement systems, built for a gentler era, began to buckle under the weight of soaring volumes. Delays at one firm held up the work of another. Securities were lost or stolen. Fails ballooned. And many thinly capitalized broker-dealers were caught by the whiplash of scuttled transactions. In desperation, trading hours were reduced and exchanges eventually closed on Wednesdays to allow firms to process the mountains of certificates. The breakdown over an antiquated system was described by the SEC chairman at the time as “the most prolonged and severe crisis in the securities industry in 40 years... Firms failed. Investor confidence plummeted.” And very much to its credit, the SEC was proactive in remedying the so-called “Paperwork Crisis.” The agency helped market participants to develop the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which would transform how securities were held and traded. [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn4) Instead of shuffling paper certificates from customer to broker, broker to broker, and broker to customer, title to shares could now be transferred through computerized ledger entries. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn5) The certificates themselves were immobilized, stored securely in vaults, as ownership moved electronically, laying the foundation for the modern clearing and settlement system that has continued to this day. The ticker tape machine—like the one here—was also a breakthrough of its time, revolutionizing how Americans accessed market information, line by line, trade by trade. [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn6) But breakthroughs don’t belong in the past. By the late 1990s, electronic trading systems surged in popularity, unsettling old assumptions about how markets should function. Chairman Arthur Levitt likewise believed it behooved the SEC to provide regulatory flexibility for the electronic markets to innovate. [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn7) So, Regulation Alternative Trading Systems, or “Reg ATS,” adopted in 1999, allowed for ATSs to be regulated like broker-dealers, rather than like exchanges. [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn8) So, this brings me to today. To a moment that demands American ambition. To a project that can unleash it. Our regulatory framework need not be anchored to an analog past—unkind to new frontiers. After all, the future is arriving at full speed—and the world is not waiting. America must do more than just keep pace with the digital asset revolution. We must drive it. ## Forging the Future: America’s Leadership in the Golden Age of Finance So today, I would like the world to go on notice that under my leadership, the SEC will not stand idly by and watch innovations develop overseas while our capital markets remain stagnant. To achieve President Trump’s vision of making America the crypto capital of the world, the SEC must holistically consider the potential benefits and risks of moving our markets from an off-chain environment to an on-chain one. We are at the threshold of a new era in the history of our markets. As I mentioned earlier, today I am announcing the launch of “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable America’s financial markets to move on-chain. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, ensuring that America will continue to lead in global payments with a gold standard stablecoin regulatory framework. Upon signing the GENIUS Act into law, I was pleased that President Trump endorsed Congressional efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation by the end of the year. I commend the House of Representatives for garnering such strong bipartisan support, and I look forward to working with the Senate as they build off the House’s work and craft market structure legislation that future proofs our markets against regulatory mischief, cementing the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Yesterday, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC and other federal agencies to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. This report is _the blueprint_ to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology. The President said last week that he wants “the entire world running on the backbone of American technology.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn9) I stand ready to help get that job done. That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the PWG’s recommendations. Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn10) Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate. In accord with the PWG Report’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to draft clear and simple rules of the road for crypto asset distributions, custody, and trading for public notice and comment. While the Commission staff works to finalize these regulations, the Commission and its staff will in the coming months consider using interpretative, exemptive, and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America. Many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations do not make sense in the twenty-first century—let alone for on-chain markets. The Commission must revamp its rulebook so that regulatory moats do not hinder progress and competition—from both new entrants and incumbents—to the detriment of Main Street. [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn11) ## Onshoring Crypto: A New Day at the SEC\n\nNow, Project Crypto will involve a broad range of initiatives across the Commission. First, we will work to bring crypto asset distributions back to America. The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over. President Trump has said that America is in its Golden Age—and under our new agenda, our crypto asset economy will be, too. In line with the PWG Report, a key priority of mine will be to establish—as swiftly as we can—a regulatory framework for distributions of crypto assets in America. Capital formation is at the heart of the SEC’s mission, yet for too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising. [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn12) As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises. The SEC’s head-in-the-sand posture—as well as its shoot first, ask questions later approach—are days of the past. Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities. But confusion over the application of the “ _Howey_ test” has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such. American entrepreneurs are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize a broad range of legacy systems and instruments. One such entrepreneur is Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a successful businessman and freshman senator, who before his election to the Senate founded a company that put car titles on the blockchain. [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn13) He saw a need for efficiency in transferring titles and devised a practical solution with the new technology.  These entrepreneurs need—and deserve—bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses. I have directed the Commission staff to work to develop clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract. Our goal is to help market participants to slot crypto assets into categories, such as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins, and assess the economic realities of a transaction. This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract. In addition, it should not be a scarlet letter to be deemed a security. We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets. Many issuers will prefer the flexibility in product design that the securities laws afford, and investors will benefit from the opportunity to earn distributions, voting rights, and other features typical of securities. Projects should not be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations and offshore foundations or decentralize too early if this is not their desired plan of action. I am excited to see new use cases for crypto asset securities in commerce, such as the ability to participate in blockchain network consensus with tokenized equities. Thus, for those crypto asset transactions that are subject to the securities laws, I have asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called “initial coin offerings,” “airdrops,” and network rewards. Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits, [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn14) but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment. It is my view that a Cambrian explosion in innovation could occur if we stay true to this course. Additionally, many firms seek to “tokenize” their common stock, bonds, partnership interests, and other securities, or tokenize the securities of third parties. [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn15) Much of this innovation is offshore today due to regulatory challenges in the United States. I also hear from our regulatory policy staff that firms—from household names on Wall Street to unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley—are lined up at our doors with requests to tokenize. I have asked the Commission staff to work with firms seeking to distribute tokenized securities within the United States and to provide relief where appropriate to assure that Americans are not left behind. ## Enhancing Freedom: Choice Among Custodians and Trading Venues Second, to achieve the President’s goals, it is incumbent on the SEC to ensure that market participants have maximum choice when deciding where to custody and trade crypto assets.  As I have said before, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a core American value. [\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn16) I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking. However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so. It will be a priority of my chairmanship to carry out the PWG Report’s recommendation to modernize the SEC’s custody requirements for registered intermediaries. The prior Administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework, SAB 121, and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” resulted in a dearth of custodial service provider options in the market today. [\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn17)  The existing custody rules were created without crypto assets in mind. I have directed the staff to consider how best to adapt the existing regime to facilitate the custody of crypto assets, including possible exemptive or other relief, in addition to changes to the rules themselves. As the PWG Report recommends, market participants “should be permitted to engage in multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible.” We should not force market participants to be stretched to fit a Procrustean bed of regulation for regulation’s sake. I am in favor of affording them the freedom to choose the most efficient regulatory framework for their business, provided that the framework adequately protects investors. ## Facilitating Super-Apps: Horizontal Integration of Product Offerings Third, a key priority of my chairmanship is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps.” [\\[18\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn18) I am often asked, “What do you mean by a super-app?” Plain and simple: securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license. A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses. Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today, and I have directed the Commission staff to develop further guidance and proposals ultimately to make this “super-app” vision a reality. Maybe they’ll call it “Reg Super-App.” Consistent with the PWG Report, the SEC in concert with other regulators should strive to have the most efficient licensing structure for SEC registrants. They should not be unnecessarily subject to multiple regulators or regulatory regimes. This model has worked well for banks, which are broadly exempted from many duplicative regulatory frameworks, such as broker-dealer and clearing agency registration. Regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation necessary to protect investors while allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish. We should not overburden them with paternalistic regulation that could drive them offshore or make American companies less competitive internationally. Our regulators should unleash the forces of venue and product competition for the benefit of all Americans. We should not artificially constrain business models and impose duplicative regulatory costs on American businesses that favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens. Per the PWG’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to develop a framework that will allow non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to be traded side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms. Additionally, I have asked the staff to evaluate the use of Commission authority to permit non-security crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract to trade on trading venues that are not registered with the Commission. I am keen to pursue such a solution, as it will not only enable state-licensed crypto asset platforms that are not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets, but it also clears the way for CFTC-regulated platforms to offer these products with margin capabilities—even without Congress providing the CFTC with any additional authority, unlocking even greater liquidity for these assets. ## Unleashing U.S. Markets: Big Beautiful On-Chain Software Systems Fourth, I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets. On-chain software comes in many shapes and sizes—some of these systems are truly decentralized and not operated by any intermediary. Other on-chain software systems have an operator. Both types of on-chain software should have a place within our financial markets. It is essential that any crypto asset regulatory market structurecreate a path for software developers to unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary. Decentralized finance software systems—like automated market makers—facilitate automated, non-intermediated financial market activity. Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them. We will create space in our markets for both models, by protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems. Decentralized finance and other forms of on-chain software systems will be part of our securities markets and not drowned out by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. To make this vision a reality, we will need to consider some changes to our rules. For example, accommodating trading of tokenized securities on-chain may require us to explore amendments to Reg NMS, in addition to what we otherwise would do in the normal course to correct market distortions that it engenders. Many of you will remember that I co-authored with Commissioner Cynthia Glassman a lengthy dissent to the adoption of Reg NMS twenty years ago last month. [\\[19\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn19) This dissent is even more compelling now that we have had two decades of prescriptive requirements that distort market activity and impede the evolution of our securities markets. Congress clearly intended that “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn20) I will look for ways to bring us back in line with that intent and thereby promote innovation and competition in our markets. ## Fostering Innovation:  Commercial Viability is Our True North Finally, innovation and entrepreneurialism are the engines of the American economy. President Trump has described America as a “nation of builders.” [\\[21\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn21) Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation’s builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules. While the Commission is actively considering industry requests that could jumpstart innovative activity, we are also contemplating an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly go to market with new business models and services that do not neatly fit within our existing rules and regulations. The Commission will continue to ensure that market participants adhere to certain conditions and requirements designed to achieve the policy aims of the federal securities laws. Under my vision for an innovation exemption, innovators and visionaries will be able to immediately enter the market with new technologies and business models but will not be required to comply with incompatible or burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity. Instead, they will be able to comply with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643. [\\[22\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn22) I encourage market participants and SEC staff alike to have an eye towards commercial viability when contemplating what various models could look like. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\n\nAs we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. This represents more than a regulatory shift—it is a generational opportunity. From the leaves of a buttonwood tree to ledgers on a blockchain, the winds of innovation still blow—and it is our task that they carry American leadership forward. After all, ladies and gentlemen, we have never been content to follow. We will not watch from the sidelines. We will lead. We will build. And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America. Thank you very much for your time today. I encourage you to be attentive to our coming announcements and proposals and, as always, I welcome your thoughtful comments and suggestions.\n\n* * *\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref1) The White House, _Issues: Technology & Innovation_, [https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/tech-innovation/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/tech-innovation/).\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref2) _See The History of NYSE,_ New York Stock Exchange, https://www.nyse.com/history-of-nyse.\n\n[\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref3) _See Wall Street: The Paperwork Predicament_, Time Magazine (June 21, 1968), https://time.com/archive/6636314/wall-street-the-paperwork-predicament/.\n\n[\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref4) _See A Short History of the Depository Trust Company_, Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society (1999), https://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1990/1999\\_0101\\_DTCHistory.pdf.\n\n[\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref5) _Id._\n\n[\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref6) Danny Lewis, _The Physical Stock Ticker Is a Relic, But Its Influence Reverberates Loudly Today_, Smithsonian Magazine (Nov. 15, 2016), https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-physical-stock-ticker-is-a-relic-but-its-influence-reverberates-loudly-today-180961092/.\n\n[\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref7) _Transformation & Regulation: Equities Market Structure, 1934 to 2018: Reg ATS_, Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society, https://www.sechistorical.org/museum/galleries/msr/msr04c\\_reg\\_ats.php.\n\n[\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref8) _Id._\n\n[\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref9) Justin Hendrix, _Transcript: Donald Trump’s Address at ‘Winning the AI Race’ Event_, TechPolicy.Press (July 24, 2025), [https://www.techpolicy.press/transcript-donald-trumps-address-at-winning-the-ai-race-event/](https://www.techpolicy.press/transcript-donald-trumps-address-at-winning-the-ai-race-event/).\n\n[\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftnref10) _See, e.g._, David H.

        "paragraphs": [
          "Good afternoon. Thank you, Norm, for your kind introduction and the invitation to be here. It gives me great pleasure to be with you all, particularly at what I believe is a defining moment for American leadership in the crypto asset markets. Before I share a few reflections, I want to thank the America First Policy Institute for convening such a timely conversation. And, I must note, in order to keep my compliance folks happy, that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*",
          "Today, I would like to discuss what Commissioner Hester Peirce and I are calling “Project Crypto,” which will be the SEC’s north star in aiding President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn1) But before I discuss our plan for crypto market primacy, let me take a few moments to revisit some inflection points in the history of our financial markets that bear similarities to the one we are at now, so that the future we shape is worthy of the legacy that we inherit. ## Evolution of Capital Markets: From Buttonwood to Blockchain The winds of innovation have always swept through our capital markets, often at gale force. In 1792, they rustled the leaves of a buttonwood tree, beneath which two dozen stockbrokers assembled to establish the forerunner to the New York Stock Exchange. That modest agreement—fewer than a hundred words handwritten on a slip of parchment—set in motion an elegant design that would govern the flow of capital for generations. [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn2) In the centuries since, our markets have never stood still. They have expanded, evolved, and reinvented themselves in step with the ideas and technologies of their time. Markets are dynamic because of the people who participate in them. Markets channel human ingenuity toward society’s most intractable problems by rewarding those who develop the most innovative solutions that others value enough to buy. They are the mechanism by which Adam Smith’s invisible hand elevates those who act in the common good—even when pursuing their own. The SEC’s role is to safeguard markets that allow the spark of human creativity and skill to benefit society. Over the arc of its history, the agency has both enabled innovation and, regrettably at times, stifled it. Fortunately, progress has a way of prevailing. And when our regulatory posture is calibrated to meet innovation with thoughtfulness rather than fear, America’s leadership position has only grown stronger. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*",
          "In the 1960s—before my time, I am happy to say—Wall Street was riding a bull market. But behind the scenes, our market machinery was straining to keep up. Most clearing and settlement transactions involved a costly and cumbersome process. Rising stacks of paper stock certificates had to be physically delivered by clerks wheeling carts up and down Wall Street and in other financial districts all across America. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn3) It was a scene from another century struggling to meet the demands of the modern securities markets. Indeed, the paper-based clearance and settlement systems, built for a gentler era, began to buckle under the weight of soaring volumes. Delays at one firm held up the work of another. Securities were lost or stolen. Fails ballooned. And many thinly capitalized broker-dealers were caught by the whiplash of scuttled transactions. In desperation, trading hours were reduced and exchanges eventually closed on Wednesdays to allow firms to process the mountains of certificates. The breakdown over an antiquated system was described by the SEC chairman at the time as “the most prolonged and severe crisis in the securities industry in 40 years... Firms failed. Investor confidence plummeted.” And very much to its credit, the SEC was proactive in remedying the so-called “Paperwork Crisis.” The agency helped market participants to develop the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which would transform how securities were held and traded. [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn4) Instead of shuffling paper certificates from customer to broker, broker to broker, and broker to customer, title to shares could now be transferred through computerized ledger entries. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn5) The certificates themselves were immobilized, stored securely in vaults, as ownership moved electronically, laying the foundation for the modern clearing and settlement system that has continued to this day. The ticker tape machine—like the one here—was also a breakthrough of its time, revolutionizing how Americans accessed market information, line by line, trade by trade. [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn6) But breakthroughs don’t belong in the past. By the late 1990s, electronic trading systems surged in popularity, unsettling old assumptions about how markets should function. Chairman Arthur Levitt likewise believed it behooved the SEC to provide regulatory flexibility for the electronic markets to innovate. [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn7) So, Regulation Alternative Trading Systems, or “Reg ATS,” adopted in 1999, allowed for ATSs to be regulated like broker-dealers, rather than like exchanges. [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn8) So, this brings me to today. To a moment that demands American ambition. To a project that can unleash it. Our regulatory framework need not be anchored to an analog past—unkind to new frontiers. After all, the future is arriving at full speed—and the world is not waiting. America must do more than just keep pace with the digital asset revolution. We must drive it. ## Forging the Future: America’s Leadership in the Golden Age of Finance So today, I would like the world to go on notice that under my leadership, the SEC will not stand idly by and watch innovations develop overseas while our capital markets remain stagnant. To achieve President Trump’s vision of making America the crypto capital of the world, the SEC must holistically consider the potential benefits and risks of moving our markets from an off-chain environment to an on-chain one. We are at the threshold of a new era in the history of our markets. As I mentioned earlier, today I am announcing the launch of “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable America’s financial markets to move on-chain. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, ensuring that America will continue to lead in global payments with a gold standard stablecoin regulatory framework. Upon signing the GENIUS Act into law, I was pleased that President Trump endorsed Congressional efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation by the end of the year. I commend the House of Representatives for garnering such strong bipartisan support, and I look forward to working with the Senate as they build off the House’s work and craft market structure legislation that future proofs our markets against regulatory mischief, cementing the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Yesterday, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC and other federal agencies to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. This report is _the blueprint_ to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology. The President said last week that he wants “the entire world running on the backbone of American technology.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn9) I stand ready to help get that job done. That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the PWG’s recommendations. Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn10) Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate. In accord with the PWG Report’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to draft clear and simple rules of the road for crypto asset distributions, custody, and trading for public notice and comment. While the Commission staff works to finalize these regulations, the Commission and its staff will in the coming months consider using interpretative, exemptive, and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America. Many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations do not make sense in the twenty-first century—let alone for on-chain markets. The Commission must revamp its rulebook so that regulatory moats do not hinder progress and competition—from both new entrants and incumbents—to the detriment of Main Street. [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn11) ## Onshoring Crypto: A New Day at the SEC",
          "Now, Project Crypto will involve a broad range of initiatives across the Commission. First, we will work to bring crypto asset distributions back to America. The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over. President Trump has said that America is in its Golden Age—and under our new agenda, our crypto asset economy will be, too. In line with the PWG Report, a key priority of mine will be to establish—as swiftly as we can—a regulatory framework for distributions of crypto assets in America. Capital formation is at the heart of the SEC’s mission, yet for too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising. [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn12) As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises. The SEC’s head-in-the-sand posture—as well as its shoot first, ask questions later approach—are days of the past. Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities. But confusion over the application of the “ _Howey_ test” has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such. American entrepreneurs are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize a broad range of legacy systems and instruments. One such entrepreneur is Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a successful businessman and freshman senator, who before his election to the Senate founded a company that put car titles on the blockchain. [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn13) He saw a need for efficiency in transferring titles and devised a practical solution with the new technology.  These entrepreneurs need—and deserve—bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses. I have directed the Commission staff to work to develop clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract. Our goal is to help market participants to slot crypto assets into categories, such as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins, and assess the economic realities of a transaction. This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract. In addition, it should not be a scarlet letter to be deemed a security. We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets. Many issuers will prefer the flexibility in product design that the securities laws afford, and investors will benefit from the opportunity to earn distributions, voting rights, and other features typical of securities. Projects should not be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations and offshore foundations or decentralize too early if this is not their desired plan of action. I am excited to see new use cases for crypto asset securities in commerce, such as the ability to participate in blockchain network consensus with tokenized equities. Thus, for those crypto asset transactions that are subject to the securities laws, I have asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called “initial coin offerings,” “airdrops,” and network rewards. Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits, [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn14) but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment. It is my view that a Cambrian explosion in innovation could occur if we stay true to this course. Additionally, many firms seek to “tokenize” their common stock, bonds, partnership interests, and other securities, or tokenize the securities of third parties. [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn15) Much of this innovation is offshore today due to regulatory challenges in the United States. I also hear from our regulatory policy staff that firms—from household names on Wall Street to unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley—are lined up at our doors with requests to tokenize. I have asked the Commission staff to work with firms seeking to distribute tokenized securities within the United States and to provide relief where appropriate to assure that Americans are not left behind. ## Enhancing Freedom: Choice Among Custodians and Trading Venues Second, to achieve the President’s goals, it is incumbent on the SEC to ensure that market participants have maximum choice when deciding where to custody and trade crypto assets.  As I have said before, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a core American value. [\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn16) I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking. However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so. It will be a priority of my chairmanship to carry out the PWG Report’s recommendation to modernize the SEC’s custody requirements for registered intermediaries. The prior Administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework, SAB 121, and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” resulted in a dearth of custodial service provider options in the market today. [\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn17)  The existing custody rules were created without crypto assets in mind. I have directed the staff to consider how best to adapt the existing regime to facilitate the custody of crypto assets, including possible exemptive or other relief, in addition to changes to the rules themselves. As the PWG Report recommends, market participants “should be permitted to engage in multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible.” We should not force market participants to be stretched to fit a Procrustean bed of regulation for regulation’s sake. I am in favor of affording them the freedom to choose the most efficient regulatory framework for their business, provided that the framework adequately protects investors. ## Facilitating Super-Apps: Horizontal Integration of Product Offerings Third, a key priority of my chairmanship is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps.” [\\[18\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn18) I am often asked, “What do you mean by a super-app?” Plain and simple: securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license. A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses. Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today, and I have directed the Commission staff to develop further guidance and proposals ultimately to make this “super-app” vision a reality. Maybe they’ll call it “Reg Super-App.” Consistent with the PWG Report, the SEC in concert with other regulators should strive to have the most efficient licensing structure for SEC registrants. They should not be unnecessarily subject to multiple regulators or regulatory regimes. This model has worked well for banks, which are broadly exempted from many duplicative regulatory frameworks, such as broker-dealer and clearing agency registration. Regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation necessary to protect investors while allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish. We should not overburden them with paternalistic regulation that could drive them offshore or make American companies less competitive internationally. Our regulators should unleash the forces of venue and product competition for the benefit of all Americans. We should not artificially constrain business models and impose duplicative regulatory costs on American businesses that favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens. Per the PWG’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to develop a framework that will allow non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to be traded side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms. Additionally, I have asked the staff to evaluate the use of Commission authority to permit non-security crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract to trade on trading venues that are not registered with the Commission. I am keen to pursue such a solution, as it will not only enable state-licensed crypto asset platforms that are not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets, but it also clears the way for CFTC-regulated platforms to offer these products with margin capabilities—even without Congress providing the CFTC with any additional authority, unlocking even greater liquidity for these assets. ## Unleashing U.S. Markets: Big Beautiful On-Chain Software Systems Fourth, I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets. On-chain software comes in many shapes and sizes—some of these systems are truly decentralized and not operated by any intermediary. Other on-chain software systems have an operator. Both types of on-chain software should have a place within our financial markets. It is essential that any crypto asset regulatory market structurecreate a path for software developers to unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary. Decentralized finance software systems—like automated market makers—facilitate automated, non-intermediated financial market activity. Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them. We will create space in our markets for both models, by protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems. Decentralized finance and other forms of on-chain software systems will be part of our securities markets and not drowned out by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. To make this vision a reality, we will need to consider some changes to our rules. For example, accommodating trading of tokenized securities on-chain may require us to explore amendments to Reg NMS, in addition to what we otherwise would do in the normal course to correct market distortions that it engenders. Many of you will remember that I co-authored with Commissioner Cynthia Glassman a lengthy dissent to the adoption of Reg NMS twenty years ago last month. [\\[19\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn19) This dissent is even more compelling now that we have had two decades of prescriptive requirements that distort market activity and impede the evolution of our securities markets. Congress clearly intended that “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn20) I will look for ways to bring us back in line with that intent and thereby promote innovation and competition in our markets. ## Fostering Innovation:  Commercial Viability is Our True North Finally, innovation and entrepreneurialism are the engines of the American economy. President Trump has described America as a “nation of builders.” [\\[21\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn21) Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation’s builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules. While the Commission is actively considering industry requests that could jumpstart innovative activity, we are also contemplating an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly go to market with new business models and services that do not neatly fit within our existing rules and regulations. The Commission will continue to ensure that market participants adhere to certain conditions and requirements designed to achieve the policy aims of the federal securities laws. Under my vision for an innovation exemption, innovators and visionaries will be able to immediately enter the market with new technologies and business models but will not be required to comply with incompatible or burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity. Instead, they will be able to comply with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643. [\\[22\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn22) I encourage market participants and SEC staff alike to have an eye towards commercial viability when contemplating what various models could look like. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*",
          "As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. This represents more than a regulatory shift—it is a generational opportunity. From the leaves of a buttonwood tree to ledgers on a blockchain, the winds of innovation still blow—and it is our task that they carry American leadership forward. After all, ladies and gentlemen, we have never been content to follow. We will not watch from the sidelines. We will lead. We will build. And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America. Thank you very much for your time today.

          "In line with the PWG Report, a key priority of mine will be to establish—as swiftly as we can—a regulatory framework for distributions of crypto assets in America",
          "Capital formation is at the heart of the SEC’s mission, yet for too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising",
          "[\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn12) As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises",
          "The SEC’s head-in-the-sand posture—as well as its shoot first, ask questions later approach—are days of the past",
          "Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities",
          "But confusion over the application of the “ _Howey_ test” has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such",
          "American entrepreneurs are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize a broad range of legacy systems and instruments",
          "One such entrepreneur is Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a successful businessman and freshman senator, who before his election to the Senate founded a company that put car titles on the blockchain",
          "[\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn13) He saw a need for efficiency in transferring titles and devised a practical solution with the new technology",
          "These entrepreneurs need—and deserve—bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses",
          "I have directed the Commission staff to work to develop clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract",
          "Our goal is to help market participants to slot crypto assets into categories, such as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins, and assess the economic realities of a transaction",
          "This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract",
          "In addition, it should not be a scarlet letter to be deemed a security",
          "We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets",
          "Many issuers will prefer the flexibility in product design that the securities laws afford, and investors will benefit from the opportunity to earn distributions, voting rights, and other features typical of securities",
          "Projects should not be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations and offshore foundations or decentralize too early if this is not their desired plan of action",
          "I am excited to see new use cases for crypto asset securities in commerce, such as the ability to participate in blockchain network consensus with tokenized equities",
          "Thus, for those crypto asset transactions that are subject to the securities laws, I have asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called “initial coin offerings,” “airdrops,” and network rewards",
          "Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits, [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn14) but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment",
          "It is my view that a Cambrian explosion in innovation could occur if we stay true to this course",
          "Additionally, many firms seek to “tokenize” their common stock, bonds, partnership interests, and other securities, or tokenize the securities of third parties",
          "[\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn15) Much of this innovation is offshore today due to regulatory challenges in the United States",
          "I also hear from our regulatory policy staff that firms—from household names on Wall Street to unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley—are lined up at our doors with requests to tokenize",
          "I have asked the Commission staff to work with firms seeking to distribute tokenized securities within the United States and to provide relief where appropriate to assure that Americans are not left behind",
          "## Enhancing Freedom: Choice Among Custodians and Trading Venues Second, to achieve the President’s goals, it is incumbent on the SEC to ensure that market participants have maximum choice when deciding where to custody and trade crypto assets",
          "As I have said before, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a core American value",
          "[\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn16) I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking",
          "However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so",
          "It will be a priority of my chairmanship to carry out the PWG Report’s recommendation to modernize the SEC’s custody requirements for registered intermediaries",
          "The prior Administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework, SAB 121, and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” resulted in a dearth of custodial service provider options in the market today",
          "[\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn17)  The existing custody rules were created without crypto assets in mind",
          "I have directed the staff to consider how best to adapt the existing regime to facilitate the custody of crypto assets, including possible exemptive or other relief, in addition to changes to the rules themselves",
          "As the PWG Report recommends, market participants “should be permitted to engage in multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible.” We should not force market participants to be stretched to fit a Procrustean bed of regulation for regulation’s sake",
          "I am in favor of affording them the freedom to choose the most efficient regulatory framework for their business, provided that the framework adequately protects investors",
          "## Facilitating Super-Apps: Horizontal Integration of Product Offerings Third, a key priority of my chairmanship is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps.” [\\[18\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn18) I am often asked, “What do you mean by a super-app?” Plain and simple: securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license",
          "A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses",
          "Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today, and I have directed the Commission staff to develop further guidance and proposals ultimately to make this “super-app” vision a reality",
          "Maybe they’ll call it “Reg Super-App.” Consistent with the PWG Report, the SEC in concert with other regulators should strive to have the most efficient licensing structure for SEC registrants",
          "They should not be unnecessarily subject to multiple regulators or regulatory regimes",
          "This model has worked well for banks, which are broadly exempted from many duplicative regulatory frameworks, such as broker-dealer and clearing agency registration",
          "Regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation necessary to protect investors while allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish",
          "We should not overburden them with paternalistic regulation that could drive them offshore or make American companies less competitive internationally",
          "Our regulators should unleash the forces of venue and product competition for the benefit of all Americans",
          "We should not artificially constrain business models and impose duplicative regulatory costs on American businesses that favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens",
          "Per the PWG’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to develop a framework that will allow non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to be traded side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms",
          "Additionally, I have asked the staff to evaluate the use of Commission authority to permit non-security crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract to trade on trading venues that are not registered with the Commission",
          "I am keen to pursue such a solution, as it will not only enable state-licensed crypto asset platforms that are not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets, but it also clears the way for CFTC-regulated platforms to offer these products with margin capabilities—even without Congress providing the CFTC with any additional authority, unlocking even greater liquidity for these assets",
          "Markets: Big Beautiful On-Chain Software Systems Fourth, I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets",
          "On-chain software comes in many shapes and sizes—some of these systems are truly decentralized and not operated by any intermediary",
          "Other on-chain software systems have an operator",
          "Both types of on-chain software should have a place within our financial markets",
          "It is essential that any crypto asset regulatory market structurecreate a path for software developers to unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary",
          "Decentralized finance software systems—like automated market makers—facilitate automated, non-intermediated financial market activity",
          "Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them",
          "We will create space in our markets for both models, by protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems",
          "Decentralized finance and other forms of on-chain software systems will be part of our securities markets and not drowned out by duplicative or unnecessary regulation",
          "To make this vision a reality, we will need to consider some changes to our rules",
          "For example, accommodating trading of tokenized securities on-chain may require us to explore amendments to Reg NMS, in addition to what we otherwise would do in the normal course to correct market distortions that it engenders",
          "Many of you will remember that I co-authored with Commissioner Cynthia Glassman a lengthy dissent to the adoption of Reg NMS twenty years ago last month",
          "[\\[19\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn19) This dissent is even more compelling now that we have had two decades of prescriptive requirements that distort market activity and impede the evolution of our securities markets",
          "Congress clearly intended that “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn20) I will look for ways to bring us back in line with that intent and thereby promote innovation and competition in our markets",
          "## Fostering Innovation:  Commercial Viability is Our True North Finally, innovation and entrepreneurialism are the engines of the American economy",
          "President Trump has described America as a “nation of builders.” [\\[21\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn21) Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation’s builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules",
          "While the Commission is actively considering industry requests that could jumpstart innovative activity, we are also contemplating an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly go to market with new business models and services that do not neatly fit within our existing rules and regulations",
          "The Commission will continue to ensure that market participants adhere to certain conditions and requirements designed to achieve the policy aims of the federal securities laws",
          "Under my vision for an innovation exemption, innovators and visionaries will be able to immediately enter the market with new technologies and business models but will not be required to comply with incompatible or burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity",
          "Instead, they will be able to comply with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws",
          "These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643",
          "[\\[22\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-digital-finance-revolution-073125#_ftn22) I encourage market participants and SEC staff alike to have an eye towards commercial viability when contemplating what various models could look like",
          "\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\n\nAs we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States the crypto capital of the world",
          "This represents more than a regulatory shift—it is a generational opportunity",
          "From the leaves of a buttonwood tree to ledgers on a blockchain, the winds of innovation still blow—and it is our task that they carry American leadership forward",
          "After all, ladies and gentlemen, we have never been content to follow",
          "We will not watch from the sidelines",
          "And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America",
          "Thank you very much for your time today",
          "I encourage you to be attentive to our coming announcements and proposals and, as always, I welcome your thoughtful comments and suggestions",

        "full_text": "Thank you, Chairman \\[Chris\\] Hayward. You have once again gone out of your way to make me feel welcome in London. Thank you also to all of you who are here today. Before I begin, I must remind you that my views are my own as a Commissioner of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners or of anyone else in U.S. Government. It is an honor to stand before you in this grand and historic room. The Guildhall is a symbol of resilience—the site is rich with centuries of history that enliven a vibrant present—and renewal—when fire or war has damaged the place, reconstruction followed. Notably, the Guildhall survived London’s Great Fire of 1666, though not fully intact. [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn1) Samuel Pepys, the go-to eyewitness of the fire that burned much of London to the ground, described watching “the fire grow . . . in a most horrid malicious bloody flame” so that it “made \\[him\\] weep to see it.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn2) Although the fire’s official death toll was remarkably low at six people, the four-day conflagration caused years of immeasurable human suffering for an overwhelmingly homeless, and universally, haunted population. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn3) Pepys, whose house survived the blaze—as presumably did the Parmesan cheese he had buried before fleeing the oncoming flames [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn4)—remarked a few days after the fire that he “sleeping and waking had a fear of fire in my heart” [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn5) and in 1667 still could not “sleep at night without great terrors of fire.” [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn6) Rebuilding began right away but took decades to complete. In December 1667, Pepys observed that “the city \\[had\\] got a pace on in the rebuilding of Guildhall.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn7) As with any large-scale reconstruction, conflicting architectural plans, regulatory uncertainty, [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn8) and legal wrangling about how to rebuild and who foots the bill sometimes slowed progress. But, with the help of its financial markets, [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn9) the city rebuilt itself from the ashes, this time with less flammable materials. [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn10) London’s ability to survive and thrive after the Great Fire served as a precedent for its later perseverance through and recovery from the ravages of World War II bombings of the city. Pepys was not around to document those events, but photographic evidence tells of the destruction and suffering in a way that words could not.

[\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn12) Again, London rebuilt the Guildhall and the rest of itself from its bombed ruins into a thriving metropolis. The United States through the Marshall Plan and other measures helped to finance that effort. That assistance, a continuation of the wartime alliance, is evidence of a relationship that runs deep between our nations. Physical manifestations of that connection exist in the damaged London church that was reconstructed as a memorial to Winston Churchill in Missouri [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn13) and in the bomb detritus that was shipped from the United Kingdom in empty aid ships returning to the United States and used to build parts of New York City. [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn14) The US-UK bond also reveals itself in the intertwining of our markets for human talent, capital, physical goods, and services, including financial services. Smart financial regulation embraces and perpetuates the knitting together of our two nations. Because we share so many of the same principles, the United Kingdom is a natural partner with the United States in the endeavor to foster resilient and robust global capital markets. We have a long history of working together. We both have common-law systems that afford strong legal protections to investors. We share an appreciation for the role capital markets play in empowering our people to build a vibrant, prosperous society. We both recognize the importance of market-driven capital allocation decisions in ensuring that society builds the right things and builds them well. We both acknowledge the importance of innovation and competition in serving people’s needs. Both jurisdictions value an environment in which incumbents and new entrants can try new things and change the way old systems work. Both jurisdictions, by promulgating and implementing generally sensible and properly focused regulatory frameworks, have fostered capital markets that attract global investors and talent. Shared principles alone are not enough to bind our markets together. Regulatory cooperation, which takes many forms, helps too. I have benefited on this trip, for example, from bilateral meetings with my UK counterparts, and similar meetings happen frequently between UK and US officials. Supervisory colleges bring regulators and supervisors together to compare notes on multinational market participants. Substituted compliance—a tool we have used in security-based swaps regulation [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn15)—enables a market participant that meets one jurisdiction’s regulatory requirements to satisfy the rules of the other jurisdiction geared toward a similar objective. UK and US regulators have worked together to overcome data access challenges to clear the way for US examinations of the more than 270 UK investment advisers serving clients in the US and for additional UK advisers to join their ranks. [\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn16) UK and US authorities also routinely cooperate on enforcement matters by, for example, facilitating one another’s investigations of potential securities law violations. Just over a year ago, I suggested another tool for regulators to use in bringing our markets together. In a comment letter to the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority on their consultation on a digital securities sandbox, I suggested a cross-border sandbox. [\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn17) The UK government had proposed a digital securities sandbox, which was limited to UK firms, to generate real-world insights about whether distributed ledger technology could streamline the issuance, trading, and settlement of securities without undermining investor protection, market integrity, or financial stability. [\\[18\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn18) I posited that a cross-border version of the sandbox could be even more effective: innovators could benefit from simultaneously serving UK and US markets; regulators, relying on information sharing agreements, could benefit by seeing more data on how complex emerging technologies operate in different contexts; and the British and American public could benefit by being served by a greater pool of product and service providers. As I envisioned it, a very flexible US micro-innovation sandbox would pair well with a UK sandbox; participants could adhere to a single set of conditions in both jurisdictions. Details matter, and I ended the letter by welcoming a discussion on how we might bring a cross-border sandbox to life. I have appreciated expressions of interest from the public and private sector in the UK, including much useful feedback gathered by Chairman Hayward and his colleagues at the City of London. Several months ago, referring to my sandbox, Chancellor Reeves advocated “explor\\[ing\\] opportunities to support industry to innovate cross-border . . . potentially allowing greater digital collaboration between capital markets in New York and London.” [\\[19\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn19) And at last night’s Mansion House Speech, Chancellor Reeves reiterated her support for “proposals for greater digital collaboration between our two financial centres.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn20) The goal of future conversations between our two jurisdictions should be a financial system better able to serve UK and US investors, innovators, and entrepreneurs. A sandbox can serve as a bridge between our current rulebooks and future financial markets by allowing people to experiment with technology that may underpin the markets of the future. As I have thought more about the sandbox idea in the past year and talked with others, several themes have emerged. First, perhaps the term “sandbox” undersells the efficacy of the tool. “Sandbox” describes a regulatory mechanism that the UK and other jurisdictions have put to productive use. [\\[21\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn21) Yet the term evokes for some an isolated laboratory environment with no prospect of long-term commercialization and for others children at play. Innovators are childlike only in their healthy sense of curiosity, which enables them to identify and solve societal problems. As I have said before, beaches are better than sandboxes. Beaches give innovators more room to formulate and reformulate ideas within eyeshot of the regulator—in this analogy the lifeguard—but lifeguards do not opine every time a beachgoer adds a turret to her sandcastle, as a regulator sitting in a sandbox with the innovator might be tempted to do. [\\[22\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn22) Despite its appeal to this freedom-lover, “cross-border beach” is unlikely to catch on as a term. Maybe we can come up with another descriptor such as technology incubator, but meanwhile we are stuck with “sandbox.” Second, a sandbox has limited utility unless it comes with a smooth exit ramp that takes the participant into a workable permanent regulatory environment. Incorporating an effective exit ramp facilitates commercial experiments that lead to better, cheaper products and services and a more resilient and efficient financial market infrastructure. Third, and related, a sandbox with time, customer, or activity limits, absent a nimble mechanism to extend the timeline or raise the limits, could put sand in the gears of a growing company or even bring it to a screeching halt. After a period of slow and steady growth, user interest might spike suddenly. If a regulator were not able to react quickly, the company would have to turn new users away, which could color adversely the public’s perception of the company. Similarly, regulators must stand ready to work with participants to change conditions as needed. As part of the standard innovation process, a team may start with one idea and pivot in response to market demand. Fourth, incumbent firms and new entrants should have equal access to the sandbox. Some observers worry that if entry criteria are not transparent, the sandbox could become a mechanism for regulators to pick winners. Everyone should be able to participate on the same terms, but the whole point of a sandbox is to accommodate experimentation with different ways of doing things. Transparent terms available to everyone with an option to iterate may address this concern. In operating a sandbox, regulators also must be cognizant of the cost of participating, which can be prohibitive for small entities or even for large firms if long-term commercialization is not a reality. A proactive invitation to firms of all shapes, ages, and sizes to come in and talk about whether the sandbox is right for them can help not only to combat perceptions of favoritism, but to build trust, and inform regulators of market developments. Fifth, regulators cannot force participants into a sandbox. A cross-border sandbox only makes sense if it streamlines the road to commercial viability for a company that wants to serve both the UK and the US. Sandbox projects need to be organically generated, not planned by government working groups. As London found out in rebuilding after the 1666 fire and after the wartime firebombing, grand plans drawn up by experts often give way to organic building in response to real and immediate human needs. Operationalization of a sandbox may have to wait until a company with a concrete idea for cross-border activity approaches both regulators, though I look forward to preparatory discussions in the meantime, including joint discussions with firms and both sets of regulators in the same room. Sixth, the conditions imposed by a cross-border sandbox would need to be workable for both jurisdictions. For example, I would not support conditioning a sandbox on sustainability or diversity objectives. Extracting conditions unrelated to—and potentially distracting from—the safe and effective functioning of the project would be an improper use of financial regulation to achieve political outcomes. [\\[23\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn23) Seventh, although not a new thought, many people have underscored the importance of protecting investors and markets from harm caused by sandbox activities. These objectives align with the SEC’s mission, but an often-forgotten part of protecting investors and markets is ensuring that new competitors, products, services, and ways of doing things can come into the market. A sandbox constrains, but does not eliminate, risk, which is consistent with sound regulation. As Chancellor Reeves noted last night, regulation can “go too far in seeking to eliminate risk.” [\\[24\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn24) Much of my thinking about a potential sandbox has been in connection with crypto. Blockchain technology, given its early stage and potential for transforming the way our financial system and perhaps other systems work, is ripe for experimentation. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force has received written comment on the issue of sandboxes. [\\[25\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn25) The topic of fostering experimentation also comes up in some of the Task Force’s meetings with the public. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn26) Market participants are looking to experiment with bitcoin and other crypto assets, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, digital identity solutions, collateral management, and tokenization of securities and assets such as real estate, among other issues. Blockchain allows for increased transparency, enhanced efficiency, lower costs, increased liquidity, and decentralization. In recent years, many use cases for the technology likely remained unexplored in the face of regulatory hostility or died in the labyrinth of regulatory ambiguity before they could achieve commercial success. The unique challenges and opportunities raised by blockchain technology and crypto assets and their borderless nature would lend themselves well to a mechanism for facilitating experiments and could help to identify where and how existing regulations might need to change in response. Because market participants are exploring numerous models, a sandbox for tokenizing securities might make sense. Building in cross-border interoperability will be easier now than later when business models have matured. I head back to the US today with the hope that the Crypto Task Force can collaborate with the FCA in coordination with our domestic colleagues across the government and in the context of the Administration’s broader cooperation with the United Kingdom. Because I prize the ability of capital to flow to its highest and best use, regardless of borders, and of investors to share in the wealth created by entrepreneurs all over the world, I also hope that our cross-jurisdiction partnership can serve as an example of how more than just our two nations can align interests in pursuit of a freer and more prosperous society. Fundamental differences in approaches to and objectives of financial regulation, however, could impede such efforts. Securities markets are key to solving all manner of problems, but only if market participants are free to respond to market incentives rather than serving as robotic mercenaries in a government-orchestrated initiative to achieve objectives unrelated to investor protection, efficiency, competition and capital formation. As Europe’s embrace of double materiality in corporate reporting and export of its sustainability disclosure requirements have laid bare, market integration suffers when two jurisdictions diverge on core matters such as the purpose of financial statements and other securities disclosures. On a related note that may be relevant to some people in the room, the SEC recently asked for comment on the definition of a Foreign Private Issuer (“FPI”), which provides a number of specific accommodations from which eligible FPIs may currently benefit as compared to domestic issuers. [\\[27\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn27) One of the few comments to date came from an FPI based in the UK urging us “to consider carve-outs or refined eligibility criteria that preserve FPI status for companies with genuine foreign governance and infrastructure, regardless of shareholder geography or incorporation jurisdiction.” [\\[28\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn28) That first-hand perspective is valuable, and I look forward to hearing from other interested members of the public, including UK companies, on this topic with similar or differing views. Thank you for indulging me today with your attention. I hope that the coming months will bring continuing discussions about how people from our two countries can work together for our mutual prosperity and benefit. Cross-border cooperation, whether in the context of crypto or capital markets, is a good way to fan the flames of our long friendship.\n\n* * *\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftnref1) Ben Johnson, _Survivors of the Great Fire of London_, Historic UK, [https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/Survivors-of-the-Great-Fire-of-London/](https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/Survivors-of-the-Great-Fire-of-London/).\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftnref2) Samuel Pepys, Diary Entry on September 2, 1666, [https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/02/](https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/02/).\n\n[\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftnref3) For an interesting discussion of the fire and its aftermath _see_ Not Just the Tudors Podcast: _Great Fire of London_(May 28, 2023).\n\n[\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftnref4) Samuel Pepys, Diary Entry on September 4, 1666, [https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/04/](https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/09/04/).\n\n[\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftnref5).

          "Thank you, Chairman \\[Chris\\] Hayward. You have once again gone out of your way to make me feel welcome in London. Thank you also to all of you who are here today. Before I begin, I must remind you that my views are my own as a Commissioner of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners or of anyone else in U.S. Government. It is an honor to stand before you in this grand and historic room. The Guildhall is a symbol of resilience—the site is rich with centuries of history that enliven a vibrant present—and renewal—when fire or war has damaged the place, reconstruction followed. Notably, the Guildhall survived London’s Great Fire of 1666, though not fully intact. [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn1) Samuel Pepys, the go-to eyewitness of the fire that burned much of London to the ground, described watching “the fire grow . . . in a most horrid malicious bloody flame” so that it “made \\[him\\] weep to see it.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn2) Although the fire’s official death toll was remarkably low at six people, the four-day conflagration caused years of immeasurable human suffering for an overwhelmingly homeless, and universally, haunted population. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn3) Pepys, whose house survived the blaze—as presumably did the Parmesan cheese he had buried before fleeing the oncoming flames [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn4)—remarked a few days after the fire that he “sleeping and waking had a fear of fire in my heart” [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn5) and in 1667 still could not “sleep at night without great terrors of fire.” [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn6) Rebuilding began right away but took decades to complete. In December 1667, Pepys observed that “the city \\[had\\] got a pace on in the rebuilding of Guildhall.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn7) As with any large-scale reconstruction, conflicting architectural plans, regulatory uncertainty, [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn8) and legal wrangling about how to rebuild and who foots the bill sometimes slowed progress. But, with the help of its financial markets, [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn9) the city rebuilt itself from the ashes, this time with less flammable materials. [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn10) London’s ability to survive and thrive after the Great Fire served as a precedent for its later perseverance through and recovery from the ravages of World War II bombings of the city. Pepys was not around to document those events, but photographic evidence tells of the destruction and suffering in a way that words could not. [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn11) Photos of the post-air-raid Guildhall reveal a pile of rubble against a still-standing grand backdrop. [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn12) Again, London rebuilt the Guildhall and the rest of itself from its bombed ruins into a thriving metropolis. The United States through the Marshall Plan and other measures helped to finance that effort. That assistance, a continuation of the wartime alliance, is evidence of a relationship that runs deep between our nations. Physical manifestations of that connection exist in the damaged London church that was reconstructed as a memorial to Winston Churchill in Missouri [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn13) and in the bomb detritus that was shipped from the United Kingdom in empty aid ships returning to the United States and used to build parts of New York City. [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn14) The US-UK bond also reveals itself in the intertwining of our markets for human talent, capital, physical goods, and services, including financial services. Smart financial regulation embraces and perpetuates the knitting together of our two nations. Because we share so many of the same principles, the United Kingdom is a natural partner with the United States in the endeavor to foster resilient and robust global capital markets. We have a long history of working together. We both have common-law systems that afford strong legal protections to investors. We share an appreciation for the role capital markets play in empowering our people to build a vibrant, prosperous society. We both recognize the importance of market-driven capital allocation decisions in ensuring that society builds the right things and builds them well. We both acknowledge the importance of innovation and competition in serving people’s needs. Both jurisdictions value an environment in which incumbents and new entrants can try new things and change the way old systems work. Both jurisdictions, by promulgating and implementing generally sensible and properly focused regulatory frameworks, have fostered capital markets that attract global investors and talent. Shared principles alone are not enough to bind our markets together. Regulatory cooperation, which takes many forms, helps too. I have benefited on this trip, for example, from bilateral meetings with my UK counterparts, and similar meetings happen frequently between UK and US officials. Supervisory colleges bring regulators and supervisors together to compare notes on multinational market participants. Substituted compliance—a tool we have used in security-based swaps regulation [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn15)—enables a market participant that meets one jurisdiction’s regulatory requirements to satisfy the rules of the other jurisdiction geared toward a similar objective. UK and US regulators have worked together to overcome data access challenges to clear the way for US examinations of the more than 270 UK investment advisers serving clients in the US and for additional UK advisers to join their ranks. [\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn16) UK and US authorities also routinely cooperate on enforcement matters by, for example, facilitating one another’s investigations of potential securities law violations. Just over a year ago, I suggested another tool for regulators to use in bringing our markets together. In a comment letter to the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority on their consultation on a digital securities sandbox, I suggested a cross-border sandbox. [\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn17) The UK government had proposed a digital securities sandbox, which was limited to UK firms, to generate real-world insights about whether distributed ledger technology could streamline the issuance, trading, and settlement of securities without undermining investor protection, market integrity, or financial stability. [\\[18\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn18) I posited that a cross-border version of the sandbox could be even more effective: innovators could benefit from simultaneously serving UK and US markets; regulators, relying on information sharing agreements, could benefit by seeing more data on how complex emerging technologies operate in different contexts; and the British and American public could benefit by being served by a greater pool of product and service providers. As I envisioned it, a very flexible US micro-innovation sandbox would pair well with a UK sandbox; participants could adhere to a single set of conditions in both jurisdictions. Details matter, and I ended the letter by welcoming a discussion on how we might bring a cross-border sandbox to life. I have appreciated expressions of interest from the public and private sector in the UK, including much useful feedback gathered by Chairman Hayward and his colleagues at the City of London. Several months ago, referring to my sandbox, Chancellor Reeves advocated “explor\\[ing\\] opportunities to support industry to innovate cross-border . . . potentially allowing greater digital collaboration between capital markets in New York and London.” [\\[19\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn19) And at last night’s Mansion House Speech, Chancellor Reeves reiterated her support for “proposals for greater digital collaboration between our two financial centres.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn20) The goal of future conversations between our two jurisdictions should be a financial system better able to serve UK and US investors, innovators, and entrepreneurs. A sandbox can serve as a bridge between our current rulebooks and future financial markets by allowing people to experiment with technology that may underpin the markets of the future. As I have thought more about the sandbox idea in the past year and talked with others, several themes have emerged. First, perhaps the term “sandbox” undersells the efficacy of the tool. “Sandbox” describes a regulatory mechanism that the UK and other jurisdictions have put to productive use. [\\[21\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn21) Yet the term evokes for some an isolated laboratory environment with no prospect of long-term commercialization and for others children at play. Innovators are childlike only in their healthy sense of curiosity, which enables them to identify and solve societal problems. As I have said before, beaches are better than sandboxes. Beaches give innovators more room to formulate and reformulate ideas within eyeshot of the regulator—in this analogy the lifeguard—but lifeguards do not opine every time a beachgoer adds a turret to her sandcastle, as a regulator sitting in a sandbox with the innovator might be tempted to do. [\\[22\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn22) Despite its appeal to this freedom-lover, “cross-border beach” is unlikely to catch on as a term. Maybe we can come up with another descriptor such as technology incubator, but meanwhile we are stuck with “sandbox.” Second, a sandbox has limited utility unless it comes with a smooth exit ramp that takes the participant into a workable permanent regulatory environment. Incorporating an effective exit ramp facilitates commercial experiments that lead to better, cheaper products and services and a more resilient and efficient financial market infrastructure. Third, and related, a sandbox with time, customer, or activity limits, absent a nimble mechanism to extend the timeline or raise the limits, could put sand in the gears of a growing company or even bring it to a screeching halt. After a period of slow and steady growth, user interest might spike suddenly. If a regulator were not able to react quickly, the company would have to turn new users away, which could color adversely the public’s perception of the company. Similarly, regulators must stand ready to work with participants to change conditions as needed. As part of the standard innovation process, a team may start with one idea and pivot in response to market demand. Fourth, incumbent firms and new entrants should have equal access to the sandbox. Some observers worry that if entry criteria are not transparent, the sandbox could become a mechanism for regulators to pick winners. Everyone should be able to participate on the same terms, but the whole point of a sandbox is to accommodate experimentation with different ways of doing things. Transparent terms available to everyone with an option to iterate may address this concern. In operating a sandbox, regulators also must be cognizant of the cost of participating, which can be prohibitive for small entities or even for large firms if long-term commercialization is not a reality. A proactive invitation to firms of all shapes, ages, and sizes to come in and talk about whether the sandbox is right for them can help not only to combat perceptions of favoritism, but to build trust, and inform regulators of market developments. Fifth, regulators cannot force participants into a sandbox. A cross-border sandbox only makes sense if it streamlines the road to commercial viability for a company that wants to serve both the UK and the US. Sandbox projects need to be organically generated, not planned by government working groups. As London found out in rebuilding after the 1666 fire and after the wartime firebombing, grand plans drawn up by experts often give way to organic building in response to real and immediate human needs. Operationalization of a sandbox may have to wait until a company with a concrete idea for cross-border activity approaches both regulators, though I look forward to preparatory discussions in the meantime, including joint discussions with firms and both sets of regulators in the same room. Sixth, the conditions imposed by a cross-border sandbox would need to be workable for both jurisdictions. For example, I would not support conditioning a sandbox on sustainability or diversity objectives. Extracting conditions unrelated to—and potentially distracting from—the safe and effective functioning of the project would be an improper use of financial regulation to achieve political outcomes. [\\[23\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn23) Seventh, although not a new thought, many people have underscored the importance of protecting investors and markets from harm caused by sandbox activities. These objectives align with the SEC’s mission, but an often-forgotten part of protecting investors and markets is ensuring that new competitors, products, services, and ways of doing things can come into the market. A sandbox constrains, but does not eliminate, risk, which is consistent with sound regulation. As Chancellor Reeves noted last night, regulation can “go too far in seeking to eliminate risk.” [\\[24\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn24) Much of my thinking about a potential sandbox has been in connection with crypto. Blockchain technology, given its early stage and potential for transforming the way our financial system and perhaps other systems work, is ripe for experimentation. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force has received written comment on the issue of sandboxes. [\\[25\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn25) The topic of fostering experimentation also comes up in some of the Task Force’s meetings with the public. [\\[26\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn26) Market participants are looking to experiment with bitcoin and other crypto assets, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, digital identity solutions, collateral management, and tokenization of securities and assets such as real estate, among other issues. Blockchain allows for increased transparency, enhanced efficiency, lower costs, increased liquidity, and decentralization. In recent years, many use cases for the technology likely remained unexplored in the face of regulatory hostility or died in the labyrinth of regulatory ambiguity before they could achieve commercial success. The unique challenges and opportunities raised by blockchain technology and crypto assets and their borderless nature would lend themselves well to a mechanism for facilitating experiments and could help to identify where and how existing regulations might need to change in response. Because market participants are exploring numerous models, a sandbox for tokenizing securities might make sense. Building in cross-border interoperability will be easier now than later when business models have matured. I head back to the US today with the hope that the Crypto Task Force can collaborate with the FCA in coordination with our domestic colleagues across the government and in the context of the Administration’s broader cooperation with the United Kingdom. Because I prize the ability of capital to flow to its highest and best use, regardless of borders, and of investors to share in the wealth created by entrepreneurs all over the world, I also hope that our cross-jurisdiction partnership can serve as an example of how more than just our two nations can align interests in pursuit of a freer and more prosperous society. Fundamental differences in approaches to and objectives of financial regulation, however, could impede such efforts. Securities markets are key to solving all manner of problems, but only if market participants are free to respond to market incentives rather than serving as robotic mercenaries in a government-orchestrated initiative to achieve objectives unrelated to investor protection, efficiency, competition and capital formation. As Europe’s embrace of double materiality in corporate reporting and export of its sustainability disclosure requirements have laid bare, market integration suffers when two jurisdictions diverge on core matters such as the purpose of financial statements and other securities disclosures. On a related note that may be relevant to some people in the room, the SEC recently asked for comment on the definition of a Foreign Private Issuer (“FPI”), which provides a number of specific accommodations from which eligible FPIs may currently benefit as compared to domestic issuers. [\\[27\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn27) One of the few comments to date came from an FPI based in the UK urging us “to consider carve-outs or refined eligibility criteria that preserve FPI status for companies with genuine foreign governance and infrastructure, regardless of shareholder geography or incorporation jurisdiction.” [\\[28\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn28) That first-hand perspective is valuable, and I look forward to hearing from other interested members of the public, including UK companies, on this topic with similar or differing views. Thank you for indulging me today with your attention. I hope that the coming months will bring continuing discussions about how people from our two countries can work together for our mutual prosperity and benefit. Cross-border cooperation, whether in the context of crypto or capital markets, is a good way to fan the flames of our long friendship.",

          "It is an honor to stand before you in this grand and historic room",
          "The Guildhall is a symbol of resilience—the site is rich with centuries of history that enliven a vibrant present—and renewal—when fire or war has damaged the place, reconstruction followed",
          "Notably, the Guildhall survived London’s Great Fire of 1666, though not fully intact",
          "[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn1) Samuel Pepys, the go-to eyewitness of the fire that burned much of London to the ground, described watching “the fire grow",
          "in a most horrid malicious bloody flame” so that it “made \\[him\\] weep to see it.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn2) Although the fire’s official death toll was remarkably low at six people, the four-day conflagration caused years of immeasurable human suffering for an overwhelmingly homeless, and universally, haunted population",
          "[\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn3) Pepys, whose house survived the blaze—as presumably did the Parmesan cheese he had buried before fleeing the oncoming flames [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn4)—remarked a few days after the fire that he “sleeping and waking had a fear of fire in my heart” [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn5) and in 1667 still could not “sleep at night without great terrors of fire.” [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn6) Rebuilding began right away but took decades to complete",
          "In December 1667, Pepys observed that “the city \\[had\\] got a pace on in the rebuilding of Guildhall.” [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn7) As with any large-scale reconstruction, conflicting architectural plans, regulatory uncertainty, [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn8) and legal wrangling about how to rebuild and who foots the bill sometimes slowed progress",
          "But, with the help of its financial markets, [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn9) the city rebuilt itself from the ashes, this time with less flammable materials",
          "[\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn10) London’s ability to survive and thrive after the Great Fire served as a precedent for its later perseverance through and recovery from the ravages of World War II bombings of the city",
          "Pepys was not around to document those events, but photographic evidence tells of the destruction and suffering in a way that words could not",
          "[\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn11) Photos of the post-air-raid Guildhall reveal a pile of rubble against a still-standing grand backdrop",
          "[\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn12) Again, London rebuilt the Guildhall and the rest of itself from its bombed ruins into a thriving metropolis",
          "The United States through the Marshall Plan and other measures helped to finance that effort",
          "That assistance, a continuation of the wartime alliance, is evidence of a relationship that runs deep between our nations",
          "Physical manifestations of that connection exist in the damaged London church that was reconstructed as a memorial to Winston Churchill in Missouri [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn13) and in the bomb detritus that was shipped from the United Kingdom in empty aid ships returning to the United States and used to build parts of New York City",
          "[\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn14) The US-UK bond also reveals itself in the intertwining of our markets for human talent, capital, physical goods, and services, including financial services",
          "Smart financial regulation embraces and perpetuates the knitting together of our two nations",
          "Because we share so many of the same principles, the United Kingdom is a natural partner with the United States in the endeavor to foster resilient and robust global capital markets",
          "We have a long history of working together",
          "We both have common-law systems that afford strong legal protections to investors",
          "We share an appreciation for the role capital markets play in empowering our people to build a vibrant, prosperous society",
          "We both recognize the importance of market-driven capital allocation decisions in ensuring that society builds the right things and builds them well",
          "We both acknowledge the importance of innovation and competition in serving people’s needs",
          "Both jurisdictions value an environment in which incumbents and new entrants can try new things and change the way old systems work",
          "Both jurisdictions, by promulgating and implementing generally sensible and properly focused regulatory frameworks, have fostered capital markets that attract global investors and talent",
          "Shared principles alone are not enough to bind our markets together",
          "Regulatory cooperation, which takes many forms, helps too",
          "I have benefited on this trip, for example, from bilateral meetings with my UK counterparts, and similar meetings happen frequently between UK and US officials",
          "Supervisory colleges bring regulators and supervisors together to compare notes on multinational market participants",
          "Substituted compliance—a tool we have used in security-based swaps regulation [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn15)—enables a market participant that meets one jurisdiction’s regulatory requirements to satisfy the rules of the other jurisdiction geared toward a similar objective",
          "UK and US regulators have worked together to overcome data access challenges to clear the way for US examinations of the more than 270 UK investment advisers serving clients in the US and for additional UK advisers to join their ranks",
          "[\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn16) UK and US authorities also routinely cooperate on enforcement matters by, for example, facilitating one another’s investigations of potential securities law violations",
          "Just over a year ago, I suggested another tool for regulators to use in bringing our markets together",
          "In a comment letter to the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority on their consultation on a digital securities sandbox, I suggested a cross-border sandbox",
          "[\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn17) The UK government had proposed a digital securities sandbox, which was limited to UK firms, to generate real-world insights about whether distributed ledger technology could streamline the issuance, trading, and settlement of securities without undermining investor protection, market integrity, or financial stability",
          "[\\[18\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn18) I posited that a cross-border version of the sandbox could be even more effective: innovators could benefit from simultaneously serving UK and US markets; regulators, relying on information sharing agreements, could benefit by seeing more data on how complex emerging technologies operate in different contexts; and the British and American public could benefit by being served by a greater pool of product and service providers",
          "As I envisioned it, a very flexible US micro-innovation sandbox would pair well with a UK sandbox; participants could adhere to a single set of conditions in both jurisdictions",
          "Details matter, and I ended the letter by welcoming a discussion on how we might bring a cross-border sandbox to life",
          "I have appreciated expressions of interest from the public and private sector in the UK, including much useful feedback gathered by Chairman Hayward and his colleagues at the City of London",
          "Several months ago, referring to my sandbox, Chancellor Reeves advocated “explor\\[ing\\] opportunities to support industry to innovate cross-border",
          "potentially allowing greater digital collaboration between capital markets in New York and London.” [\\[19\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn19) And at last night’s Mansion House Speech, Chancellor Reeves reiterated her support for “proposals for greater digital collaboration between our two financial centres.” [\\[20\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn20) The goal of future conversations between our two jurisdictions should be a financial system better able to serve UK and US investors, innovators, and entrepreneurs",
          "A sandbox can serve as a bridge between our current rulebooks and future financial markets by allowing people to experiment with technology that may underpin the markets of the future",
          "As I have thought more about the sandbox idea in the past year and talked with others, several themes have emerged",
          "First, perhaps the term “sandbox” undersells the efficacy of the tool",
          "“Sandbox” describes a regulatory mechanism that the UK and other jurisdictions have put to productive use",
          "[\\[21\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn21) Yet the term evokes for some an isolated laboratory environment with no prospect of long-term commercialization and for others children at play",
          "Innovators are childlike only in their healthy sense of curiosity, which enables them to identify and solve societal problems",
          "As I have said before, beaches are better than sandboxes",
          "Beaches give innovators more room to formulate and reformulate ideas within eyeshot of the regulator—in this analogy the lifeguard—but lifeguards do not opine every time a beachgoer adds a turret to her sandcastle, as a regulator sitting in a sandbox with the innovator might be tempted to do",
          "[\\[22\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn22) Despite its appeal to this freedom-lover, “cross-border beach” is unlikely to catch on as a term",
          "Maybe we can come up with another descriptor such as technology incubator, but meanwhile we are stuck with “sandbox.” Second, a sandbox has limited utility unless it comes with a smooth exit ramp that takes the participant into a workable permanent regulatory environment",
          "Incorporating an effective exit ramp facilitates commercial experiments that lead to better, cheaper products and services and a more resilient and efficient financial market infrastructure",
          "Third, and related, a sandbox with time, customer, or activity limits, absent a nimble mechanism to extend the timeline or raise the limits, could put sand in the gears of a growing company or even bring it to a screeching halt",
          "After a period of slow and steady growth, user interest might spike suddenly",
          "If a regulator were not able to react quickly, the company would have to turn new users away, which could color adversely the public’s perception of the company",
          "Similarly, regulators must stand ready to work with participants to change conditions as needed",
          "As part of the standard innovation process, a team may start with one idea and pivot in response to market demand",
          "Fourth, incumbent firms and new entrants should have equal access to the sandbox",
          "Some observers worry that if entry criteria are not transparent, the sandbox could become a mechanism for regulators to pick winners",
          "Everyone should be able to participate on the same terms, but the whole point of a sandbox is to accommodate experimentation with different ways of doing things",
          "Transparent terms available to everyone with an option to iterate may address this concern",
          "In operating a sandbox, regulators also must be cognizant of the cost of participating, which can be prohibitive for small entities or even for large firms if long-term commercialization is not a reality",
          "A proactive invitation to firms of all shapes, ages, and sizes to come in and talk about whether the sandbox is right for them can help not only to combat perceptions of favoritism, but to build trust, and inform regulators of market developments",
          "Fifth, regulators cannot force participants into a sandbox",
          "A cross-border sandbox only makes sense if it streamlines the road to commercial viability for a company that wants to serve both the UK and the US",
          "Sandbox projects need to be organically generated, not planned by government working groups",
          "As London found out in rebuilding after the 1666 fire and after the wartime firebombing, grand plans drawn up by experts often give way to organic building in response to real and immediate human needs",
          "Operationalization of a sandbox may have to wait until a company with a concrete idea for cross-border activity approaches both regulators, though I look forward to preparatory discussions in the meantime, including joint discussions with firms and both sets of regulators in the same room",
          "Sixth, the conditions imposed by a cross-border sandbox would need to be workable for both jurisdictions",
          "For example, I would not support conditioning a sandbox on sustainability or diversity objectives",
          "Extracting conditions unrelated to—and potentially distracting from—the safe and effective functioning of the project would be an improper use of financial regulation to achieve political outcomes",
          "[\\[23\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn23) Seventh, although not a new thought, many people have underscored the importance of protecting investors and markets from harm caused by sandbox activities",
          "These objectives align with the SEC’s mission, but an often-forgotten part of protecting investors and markets is ensuring that new competitors, products, services, and ways of doing things can come into the market",
          "A sandbox constrains, but does not eliminate, risk, which is consistent with sound regulation",
          "As Chancellor Reeves noted last night, regulation can “go too far in seeking to eliminate risk.” [\\[24\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn24) Much of my thinking about a potential sandbox has been in connection with crypto",
          "Blockchain technology, given its early stage and potential for transforming the way our financial system and perhaps other systems work, is ripe for experimentation",
          "The SEC’s Crypto Task Force has received written comment on the issue of sandboxes",
          "[\\[25\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn25) The topic of fostering experimentation also comes up in some of the Task Force’s meetings with the public",
          "[\\[26\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn26) Market participants are looking to experiment with bitcoin and other crypto assets, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, digital identity solutions, collateral management, and tokenization of securities and assets such as real estate, among other issues",
          "Blockchain allows for increased transparency, enhanced efficiency, lower costs, increased liquidity, and decentralization",
          "In recent years, many use cases for the technology likely remained unexplored in the face of regulatory hostility or died in the labyrinth of regulatory ambiguity before they could achieve commercial success",
          "The unique challenges and opportunities raised by blockchain technology and crypto assets and their borderless nature would lend themselves well to a mechanism for facilitating experiments and could help to identify where and how existing regulations might need to change in response",
          "Because market participants are exploring numerous models, a sandbox for tokenizing securities might make sense",
          "Building in cross-border interoperability will be easier now than later when business models have matured",
          "I head back to the US today with the hope that the Crypto Task Force can collaborate with the FCA in coordination with our domestic colleagues across the government and in the context of the Administration’s broader cooperation with the United Kingdom",
          "Because I prize the ability of capital to flow to its highest and best use, regardless of borders, and of investors to share in the wealth created by entrepreneurs all over the world, I also hope that our cross-jurisdiction partnership can serve as an example of how more than just our two nations can align interests in pursuit of a freer and more prosperous society",
          "Fundamental differences in approaches to and objectives of financial regulation, however, could impede such efforts",
          "Securities markets are key to solving all manner of problems, but only if market participants are free to respond to market incentives rather than serving as robotic mercenaries in a government-orchestrated initiative to achieve objectives unrelated to investor protection, efficiency, competition and capital formation",
          "As Europe’s embrace of double materiality in corporate reporting and export of its sustainability disclosure requirements have laid bare, market integration suffers when two jurisdictions diverge on core matters such as the purpose of financial statements and other securities disclosures",
          "On a related note that may be relevant to some people in the room, the SEC recently asked for comment on the definition of a Foreign Private Issuer (“FPI”), which provides a number of specific accommodations from which eligible FPIs may currently benefit as compared to domestic issuers",
          "[\\[27\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn27) One of the few comments to date came from an FPI based in the UK urging us “to consider carve-outs or refined eligibility criteria that preserve FPI status for companies with genuine foreign governance and infrastructure, regardless of shareholder geography or incorporation jurisdiction.” [\\[28\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn28) That first-hand perspective is valuable, and I look forward to hearing from other interested members of the public, including UK companies, on this topic with similar or differing views",
          "Thank you for indulging me today with your attention",
          "I hope that the coming months will bring continuing discussions about how people from our two countries can work together for our mutual prosperity and benefit",
          "Cross-border cooperation, whether in the context of crypto or capital markets, is a good way to fan the flames of our long friendship",

        "full_text": "Good afternoon. Thank you to Chairman Atkins for convening today’s roundtable and thank you to the moderators and panelists for joining us to discuss this important topic. On a recent trip to Alaska, one of the most striking sights was the rich forests of Sitka spruces clustering on steep mountainsides climbing up from the sea. I quickly stowed my binoculars in favor of taking in the whole scene. Absent a distinguishing feature—a different tree type, an intriguing root system, a bald eagle perched on its branches, or a bear lurking in its shade—the grandeur of the forest is lost when focusing on any one tree. Trying not to lose sight of the forest for the trees in beautiful Alaska brings me back to the ugly reality of executive compensation disclosure. Over the years, executive compensation disclosure has become increasingly unwieldy and expensive and decreasingly useful. The SEC’s rules focus excessively on random trees rather than giving a realistic view of the forest. They direct readers’ attention to a set of executive compensation items that, largely, entertain the onlooker rather than educate the investor. Preparing the lengthy and complex disclosures eats up lots of resources—management time and attention, attorneys’ and accountants’ billable hours, and even trees as pages of disclosures pile up—and distort corporate decision-making. Done right, disclosure rules are one form of investor protection. Material information provided to prospective investors arms them with “a rational basis to evaluate \\[a company and\\] its securities.” [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-peirce-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn1) My primary question for today’s panels is whether our current disclosure rules on executive compensation accomplish that goal. Some executive compensation rules seem more responsive to the general public’s curiosity than a genuine investor need for material information. Painstakingly calculated tallies of perks, like rides on the corporate jet, housing allowances for overseas assignments, or car services give us a tiny window into executives’ lives, but do little to fill out an investor’s picture of the company. Lately, our rulemakings have taken a “more is better” approach to executive compensation disclosure. These tack-on rules to the growing alphabet of Item 402 of Reg S-K—we are almost all the way through the alphabet [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-peirce-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn2)—do not provide new information. Instead, these rules re-package and re-present data that investors mostly already have. Or they add details that are immaterial. Do investors even look at this “new” information? And if they do, are we confident it gives them a rational basis to evaluate a security’s price? Consider, for example, pay ratio disclosure and pay-versus-performance disclosure. In his statement of dissent on the pay ratio rule, then Commissioner Dan Gallagher noted that it could have been “marginally less useless” if it were limited to U.S. full-time employees. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-peirce-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn3) While not a ringing endorsement of the rule or any of its possible permutations, his comment highlights that even with respect to a rule mandated by Congress as this rule was, the Commission retains some latitude to implement it in the best way possible. More recently, pursuant to another Dodd-Frank mandate, the Commission adopted the pay-versus-performance rule. The overarching feedback I hear on the rule is that it is a regulatory “tax” on public companies without a corresponding benefit for investors. Management, and the high-priced consultants and lawyers they hire, spend hours preparing the various narratives, tables, and graphs that produce nothing but yawns of disinterest from investors. More concerning than the direct costs of producing executive compensation disclosures are the costs that arise from the distortion of corporate behavior in response to executive compensation disclosure mandates. Perhaps a company opts for a compensation scheme that is less effective at aligning incentives because of the way such a scheme will be reflected under SEC disclosure rules that do not necessarily represent economic reality. Or perhaps a company opts not to provide security for its executives because it appears in a laundry list of examples of perks in a 2006 Commission release that incidentally declines to define what a perk is. [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-peirce-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn4) Now may be time for the Commission to return to a more nuanced approach to personal security disclosure that considers the context in which those measures are provided. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-peirce-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn5) Some companies have even gone so far as to eliminate perks altogether while offsetting such “cost-saving” measures with increases to base salaries. Executive compensation disclosure, along with other disclosures, should reflect rather than direct corporate actions. The age-old philosophical question is whether a falling tree makes a sound when nobody is around to hear it. The more relevant and less philosophical question for today’s discussion is if the disclosures we are mandating do not provide investors a rational basis to assess a company, why mandate them at all? I look forward to hearing from today’s moderators and panelists about how we can improve our executive compensation mandates so that they serve investors.\n\n* * *\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-peirce-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftnref1) Alan B.

        "full_text": "Good afternoon. I’m sorry that I can’t be with you for today’s roundtable, which I’m certain will generate some thought-provoking ideas and conversations. Executive compensation never fails to be a hot topic. It is an issue consistently and prominently invoked in discussions of corporate responsibility and governance. And, it stands out among those topics that marry capital formation to shareholder rights and engagement. ## A Brief History\n\nThe legal history on executive compensation runs deep. Indeed, disclosure of director and officer compensation was first required of issuers in the Securities Act of 1933. [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn1 \"\") Fast forward to more modern times . . . as Chairman Atkins highlighted in his public statement calling for today’s roundtable, in 1992, the Commission issued a new compensation disclosure rule, which sought to institute digestible and tabular formats. The Commission made further amendments to refine those tables in 2006. Recognizing the “widespread support for enhanced disclosures,” then-Commissioner Atkins noted that “\\[s\\]tockholders as the owners of the corporation ought to have a window into the compensation decisions made by the boards of directors that represent their interests.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn2 \"\") Congress has also, in more recent times, weighed in on the discourse relating to executive compensation. In the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn3 \"\") and again in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Report and Consumer Protection Act, [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn4 \"\") Congress observed that executive compensation practices encouraged risk taking in a manner that exacerbated many of the problems underlying the 2008 financial crisis, and called for comprehensive reform. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn5 \"\") In particular, legislation required (among other things):\n\n- Shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachutes (“say-on-pay”);\n\n- Enhanced independence for board compensation committees and their advisers;\n\n- Disclosures about the compensation actually paid to executives compared to the issuer’s financial performance, and pay ratios between the median annual total compensation of all employees to the annual total compensation of the CEO; and\n\n- Policies regarding the recovery by the issuer of erroneously awarded compensation. [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn6 \"\")\n\nSince that time, the Commission has promulgated rules aimed at effectively implementing these provisions. For example, in 2022 the Commission implemented “pay versus performance” rules, [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn7 \"\") and rules controlling listing standards for clawback policies. [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn8 \"\") The disclosure regime set up by both rule and statute is multi-faceted. It is each principles-based and prescriptive. For example, the CD&A discussion encourages companies to a provide meaningful narrative to shareholders about the objectives and philosophy driving their compensation decisions as to all named executive officers. Issuers also have the ability to include non-financial metrics that the company has deemed important in setting incentive-based pay in its pay-versus-performance tables. On the other hand, more prescriptively, issuers must disclose specific quantitative data in the Summary Compensation and other tables about both base and incentive compensation, calculated in a manner consistent with our rules. ## Principles\n\nThroughout this long history, again and again, certain deeply rooted principles reveal themselves. It is a fundamental shareholder right – as the owner of a company’s equity – to obtain full and fair disclosure around the compensation of corporate executives. That disclosure should be easy to understand and analyze; and it should be granular and consistent to allow for comparability across peer companies and filings. It should provide critical information to shareholders, not only for proxy say-on-pay and director votes, but also in capital allocation decisions. [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn9 \"\") Good disclosures will drive capital formation. Shareholders are further entitled to a fulsome, detailed and fair picture of **_the process_** of how executive compensation is set:\n\n- Who is involved in the decision-making?\n\n- What information do those decision-makers utilize, and what factors go into their process?\n\n- What level of independence do they bring to bear?\n\n- What are their relative incentives, and are incentives to simply “go-along” with management’s demands sufficiently mitigated? [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn10 \"\")\n\nDisclosures should further allow investors to understand and evaluate the corporate incentives at play:\n\n- Do compensation packages foster long term business strategies and economic growth as opposed to “short-termism”?\n\n- Are the fates of corporate executives sufficiently aligned with relevant performance metrics? Is compensation tied to both “upsides” and “downsides”?\n\n- Do compensation packages promote corporate investments in operations, human capital, innovation, or other areas that shareholders may feel are critical to a company’s success? [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn11 \"\") What targets are being used in incentive-based calculations and are those targets aligned with shareholder goals?\n\n- Are companies sufficiently responsive to shareholder feedback?\n\nThese are lofty principles to keep in mind during today’s session. ## Questions for Discussion\n\n_Compensation Trends_ _._ The Chairman has posed a number of questions in advance of these roundtable. Many focus on how compensation is set today. I’m also interested in hearing about compensation trends. Long-term data on executive compensation can be both decision-useful for shareholders _writ large_ and can help us evaluate potential weaknesses in the market. For example, we’re just starting to realize the data from our pay versus performance rulemaking in 2022. And, the figures on “compensation actually paid” metrics are potentially revealing. The data show that the highest paid CEO in 2024, using compensation actually paid metrics, made over $6.9 billion. [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn12 \"\") The ratio of CEO to median employee pay at S&P 500 companies rose to approximately 192:1, and at the companies of the 100 highest paid CEOs, that ratio is 348:1. [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn13 \"\") Do larger data sets reveal compensation trends or practices that may foretell problems down the road? [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn14 \"\") _Material Information_ _._ Looking further into the roundtable, the Chair has posed a number of questions on what information is material to shareholders. Feedback from investors on the materiality of executive compensation disclosures has been consistently strong, from comment files in our rulemakings, to everyday conversations, to testimony in the leadup to the seminal Dodd-Frank legislation. I nonetheless encourage all shareholders to continue to comment on what is the most decision-useful information in response to the questions posed in connection with this forum. In addition, I hope commenters will discuss how data quality can be improved and made more comparable, for example, potentially by reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures. [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn15 \"\") I hope we see shareholder and issuer input alike, which goes not only for the preeminent panelists on the dais today, but also market participants of all stripes. Please use the opportunity to make your voices heard in the comment file. Additionally, staff (at the behest the Commission) has recently taken steps to limit shareholder engagement with management, in the executive compensation and other contexts, by amending staff guidance on 13D and 13G filings. [\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn16 \"\") This may put more pressure on the proxy process. How can we strengthen transparency and the quality of disclosures, both in general and specifically in light of these regulatory changes that tend to discourage shareholder communications? _Cost._ The Chairman has also posed questions relating to cost. I would encourage panelists to consider all costs in their comments, and not just those incurred by issuers (which, of course, are ultimately borne by the shareholders). Oftentimes, shareholders expend substantial sums analyzing compensation data disclosed in filings. Are there ways to use technology to lower the costs of the entire ecosystem, without sacrificing the quality of data provided to shareholders – and perhaps even _improving_ data quality? [\\[17\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn17 \"\") ## Conclusion\n\nThank you to all of the participants involved in today’s roundtable, and to the SEC staff who undoubtedly put many hours into the preparation and operations behind today’s event.\n\n* * *\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftnref1 \"\") Section 7(a) \\[15 U.S.C. 77g(a)\\] and Schedule A, Paragraph 14 \\[15 U.S.C. 77aa(14)\\].\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftnref2 \"\") Commissioner Paul S.

In the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn3 \"\") and again in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Report and Consumer Protection Act, [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn4 \"\") Congress observed that executive compensation practices encouraged risk taking in a manner that exacerbated many of the problems underlying the 2008 financial crisis, and called for comprehensive reform. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn5 \"\") In particular, legislation required (among other things):",
          "- Shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachutes (“say-on-pay”);",
          "- Enhanced independence for board compensation committees and their advisers;",
          "- Disclosures about the compensation actually paid to executives compared to the issuer’s financial performance, and pay ratios between the median annual total compensation of all employees to the annual total compensation of the CEO; and",
          "- Policies regarding the recovery by the issuer of erroneously awarded compensation. [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn6 \"\")",
          "Since that time, the Commission has promulgated rules aimed at effectively implementing these provisions. For example, in 2022 the Commission implemented “pay versus performance” rules, [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn7 \"\") and rules controlling listing standards for clawback policies. [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn8 \"\") The disclosure regime set up by both rule and statute is multi-faceted. It is each principles-based and prescriptive. For example, the CD&A discussion encourages companies to a provide meaningful narrative to shareholders about the objectives and philosophy driving their compensation decisions as to all named executive officers. Issuers also have the ability to include non-financial metrics that the company has deemed important in setting incentive-based pay in its pay-versus-performance tables. On the other hand, more prescriptively, issuers must disclose specific quantitative data in the Summary Compensation and other tables about both base and incentive compensation, calculated in a manner consistent with our rules. ## Principles",
          "Throughout this long history, again and again, certain deeply rooted principles reveal themselves. It is a fundamental shareholder right – as the owner of a company’s equity – to obtain full and fair disclosure around the compensation of corporate executives. That disclosure should be easy to understand and analyze; and it should be granular and consistent to allow for comparability across peer companies and filings. It should provide critical information to shareholders, not only for proxy say-on-pay and director votes, but also in capital allocation decisions.

          "- Are companies sufficiently responsive to shareholder feedback?",
          "These are lofty principles to keep in mind during today’s session. ## Questions for Discussion",
          "_Compensation Trends_ _._ The Chairman has posed a number of questions in advance of these roundtable. Many focus on how compensation is set today. I’m also interested in hearing about compensation trends. Long-term data on executive compensation can be both decision-useful for shareholders _writ large_ and can help us evaluate potential weaknesses in the market. For example, we’re just starting to realize the data from our pay versus performance rulemaking in 2022. And, the figures on “compensation actually paid” metrics are potentially revealing. The data show that the highest paid CEO in 2024, using compensation actually paid metrics, made over $6.9 billion. [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn12 \"\") The ratio of CEO to median employee pay at S&P 500 companies rose to approximately 192:1, and at the companies of the 100 highest paid CEOs, that ratio is 348:1. [\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn13 \"\") Do larger data sets reveal compensation trends or practices that may foretell problems down the road? [\\[14\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn14 \"\") _Material Information_ _._ Looking further into the roundtable, the Chair has posed a number of questions on what information is material to shareholders. Feedback from investors on the materiality of executive compensation disclosures has been consistently strong, from comment files in our rulemakings, to everyday conversations, to testimony in the leadup to the seminal Dodd-Frank legislation. I nonetheless encourage all shareholders to continue to comment on what is the most decision-useful information in response to the questions posed in connection with this forum. In addition, I hope commenters will discuss how data quality can be improved and made more comparable, for example, potentially by reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures. [\\[15\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn15 \"\") I hope we see shareholder and issuer input alike, which goes not only for the preeminent panelists on the dais today, but also market participants of all stripes. Please use the opportunity to make your voices heard in the comment file. Additionally, staff (at the behest the Commission) has recently taken steps to limit shareholder engagement with management, in the executive compensation and other contexts, by amending staff guidance on 13D and 13G filings. [\\[16\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-crenshaw-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn16 \"\") This may put more pressure on the proxy process. How can we strengthen transparency and the quality of disclosures, both in general and specifically in light of these regulatory changes that tend to discourage shareholder communications? _Cost._ The Chairman has also posed questions relating to cost. I would encourage panelists to consider all costs in their comments, and not just those incurred by issuers (which, of course, are ultimately borne by the shareholders). Oftentimes, shareholders expend substantial sums analyzing compensation data disclosed in filings. Are there ways to use technology to lower the costs of the entire ecosystem, without sacrificing the quality of data provided to shareholders – and perhaps even _improving_ data quality?

        "full_text": "Thank you, Chairman Atkins, for convening today’s roundtable. I look forward to engaging in a dialogue with panelists and commenters on whether the executive compensation disclosure framework can be improved. Already, the Commission has received a number of public comment letters on executive compensation, which I found helpful in preparation for today’s roundtable. [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn1 \"\") At the outset, the Commission has no authority to set or limit compensation paid at public companies, whether with respect to executives, workers, or contractors. SEC disclosures should not drive executive compensation decisions or seek to influence compensation practices. Moreover, it is inappropriate to use SEC regulations with the intent of addressing desired political or social outcomes with respect to income and wealth inequality in the United States. To the contrary, executive compensation disclosures should provide information material to an informed investment or voting decision. Attempts to control executive pay through indirect means have proven clumsy and often resulted in the exact opposite result. In the 1990s, Congress passed tax legislation to make it less favorable to provide chief executive officer (CEO) salaries in excess of $1 million. Rather than limit CEO pay, the legislation significantly accelerated equity-based forms of executive compensation. In 2006, then-Chairman Christopher Cox described this effort, which backfired: “\\[w\\]ith complete hindsight, we can now all agree that this purpose was not achieved. Indeed, this tax law change deserves pride of place in the Museum of Unintended Consequences.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn2 \"\") Other executive compensation disclosures appear to have dubious purposes. The CEO pay ratio disclosure is one such example. [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn3 \"\") There appears to be little nexus to investor protection concerns. Instead, aspects of the CEO pay ratio rule, and the underlying Dodd-Frank statutory provision, seem to have a “name and shame” motivation. [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn4 \"\") The Commission’s rulebook should not serve to further political agendas. In addition to distracting from the Commission’s primary mission of providing material information with respect to executive compensation, this rule also increases regulatory compliance costs without providing any corresponding investor benefits. We have received many recent comment letters on executive compensation that are critical of the CEO pay ratio disclosure. One letter noted that the “CEO Pay Ratio does not provide an accurate comparison of pay equity within organizations” as “various industries have different workforce and compensation structures, which prohibit meaningful evaluation.” [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn5 \"\") Another comment letter stated that the CEO pay ratio “does not appear to have played a material role in compensation committee discussions, investor decision-making, or the rapid rate of increase in executive pay relative to that of the wider workforce.” [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn6 \"\") Disclosures that are both costly and complex to produce, while not material to investment or voting decisions, are at odds with good disclosure regulations. Regarding the adoption of clawback rules, [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn7 \"\") the scope and impacts of the rule may have increased uncertainty. Specifically, market participants indicated that there is a lack of clarity as to what type of accounting errors “need to be analyzed and when boxes need to be checked …” [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn8 \"\") Further, third-party analysis indicated that few companies have analyzed the underlying accounting errors potentially requiring a clawback. [\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn9 \"\") As such, the benefit of this framework appears minimal. Perhaps these issues could have been avoided if the Commission, in its haste, had not rushed in 2022 to adopt an unadopted 2015 proposal from the Obama Administration without first updating the economic analysis and engaging with the stakeholders as how to best implement this rule. Similarly, the recent pay versus performance rule adoption relied on stale economic information—dating as far back as twenty-five years prior to the date of the reopening of the comment period. [\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn10 \"\") The Commission relied on Paperwork Reduction Act estimates that were sixteen years old, including the assumption that legal fees are only $400 per hour. [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn11 \"\") Since 2006, the Commission has added numerous requirements to the executive compensation disclosure on a piecemeal basis without undertaking a review of the overall reporting environment. The Commission is long overdue for a review of the executive compensation disclosure rules, both from the perspective of what information gets reported as well as from the lens of whether scaled disclosure is appropriate depending on the size of the reporting company. Any rules should promote transparency into compensation frameworks and structure rather than function as a tool to dictate compensation decisions. In 1992, then-Commissioner Richard Roberts addressed these concerns, when he stated: The Commission is not interested in dictating the level of pay for corporate executive officers. That is the job of the board of directors, as elected by shareholders. The Commission’s interest and jurisdiction in this area is limited to full and fair disclosure. [\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn12 \"\") These words still ring true today. The Commission should refrain from expanding its rulebook simply because some may think that executive compensation is too high.\n\nThank you to everyone who organized today’s roundtable.\n\n* * *\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftnref1 \"\") _See_ Comments on Executive Compensation Roundtable, available at [https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-855/4-855.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-855/4-855.htm).\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftnref2 \"\") Christopher Cox, Chairman, U.S. Sec. & Exch.

          "Thank you, Chairman Atkins, for convening today’s roundtable",
          "I look forward to engaging in a dialogue with panelists and commenters on whether the executive compensation disclosure framework can be improved",
          "Already, the Commission has received a number of public comment letters on executive compensation, which I found helpful in preparation for today’s roundtable",
          "[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn1 \"\") At the outset, the Commission has no authority to set or limit compensation paid at public companies, whether with respect to executives, workers, or contractors",
          "SEC disclosures should not drive executive compensation decisions or seek to influence compensation practices",
          "Moreover, it is inappropriate to use SEC regulations with the intent of addressing desired political or social outcomes with respect to income and wealth inequality in the United States",
          "To the contrary, executive compensation disclosures should provide information material to an informed investment or voting decision",
          "Attempts to control executive pay through indirect means have proven clumsy and often resulted in the exact opposite result",
          "In the 1990s, Congress passed tax legislation to make it less favorable to provide chief executive officer (CEO) salaries in excess of $1 million",
          "Rather than limit CEO pay, the legislation significantly accelerated equity-based forms of executive compensation",
          "In 2006, then-Chairman Christopher Cox described this effort, which backfired: “\\[w\\]ith complete hindsight, we can now all agree that this purpose was not achieved",
          "Indeed, this tax law change deserves pride of place in the Museum of Unintended Consequences.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn2 \"\") Other executive compensation disclosures appear to have dubious purposes",
          "The CEO pay ratio disclosure is one such example",
          "[\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn3 \"\") There appears to be little nexus to investor protection concerns",
          "Instead, aspects of the CEO pay ratio rule, and the underlying Dodd-Frank statutory provision, seem to have a “name and shame” motivation",
          "[\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn4 \"\") The Commission’s rulebook should not serve to further political agendas",
          "In addition to distracting from the Commission’s primary mission of providing material information with respect to executive compensation, this rule also increases regulatory compliance costs without providing any corresponding investor benefits",
          "We have received many recent comment letters on executive compensation that are critical of the CEO pay ratio disclosure",
          "One letter noted that the “CEO Pay Ratio does not provide an accurate comparison of pay equity within organizations” as “various industries have different workforce and compensation structures, which prohibit meaningful evaluation.” [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn5 \"\") Another comment letter stated that the CEO pay ratio “does not appear to have played a material role in compensation committee discussions, investor decision-making, or the rapid rate of increase in executive pay relative to that of the wider workforce.” [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn6 \"\") Disclosures that are both costly and complex to produce, while not material to investment or voting decisions, are at odds with good disclosure regulations",
          "Regarding the adoption of clawback rules, [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn7 \"\") the scope and impacts of the rule may have increased uncertainty",
          "Specifically, market participants indicated that there is a lack of clarity as to what type of accounting errors “need to be analyzed and when boxes need to be checked …” [\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn8 \"\") Further, third-party analysis indicated that few companies have analyzed the underlying accounting errors potentially requiring a clawback",
          "[\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn9 \"\") As such, the benefit of this framework appears minimal",
          "Perhaps these issues could have been avoided if the Commission, in its haste, had not rushed in 2022 to adopt an unadopted 2015 proposal from the Obama Administration without first updating the economic analysis and engaging with the stakeholders as how to best implement this rule",
          "Similarly, the recent pay versus performance rule adoption relied on stale economic information—dating as far back as twenty-five years prior to the date of the reopening of the comment period",
          "[\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn10 \"\") The Commission relied on Paperwork Reduction Act estimates that were sixteen years old, including the assumption that legal fees are only $400 per hour",
          "[\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn11 \"\") Since 2006, the Commission has added numerous requirements to the executive compensation disclosure on a piecemeal basis without undertaking a review of the overall reporting environment",
          "The Commission is long overdue for a review of the executive compensation disclosure rules, both from the perspective of what information gets reported as well as from the lens of whether scaled disclosure is appropriate depending on the size of the reporting company",
          "Any rules should promote transparency into compensation frameworks and structure rather than function as a tool to dictate compensation decisions",
          "In 1992, then-Commissioner Richard Roberts addressed these concerns, when he stated: The Commission is not interested in dictating the level of pay for corporate executive officers",
          "That is the job of the board of directors, as elected by shareholders",
          "The Commission’s interest and jurisdiction in this area is limited to full and fair disclosure",
          "[\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-executive-compensation-roundtable-062625#_ftn12 \"\") These words still ring true today",

Statement on the Commission’s Status Report in the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules Litigation\n\nStatement\n\n# Statement on the Commission’s Status Report in the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules Litigation\n\n[Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw](https://www.sec.gov/about/sec-commissioners/caroline-crenshaw)\n\nWashington D.C.\n\nJuly 23, 2025\n\nOn April 24, 2025—three months ago—the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit directed the Commission to provide a status update in the ongoing litigation concerning the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules, which the Commission adopted in March of 2024. [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn1 \"\") The Court “directed” the Commission to advise whether it “intends to review or reconsider the \\[R\\]ules at issue in this case.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn2 \"\") And, if the Commission has determined to take no action, the Court ordered the Commission to explain whether it “will adhere to the \\[R\\]ules if the petitions for review are denied and, if not, why it will not review or reconsider the \\[R\\]ules at this time.” [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn3 \"\")\n\nThe Court’s directive was straightforward; our answer is not. The Commission’s Status Report, filed today, states plainly enough that it has no intention of revisiting the Rules at this time. [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn4 \"\") That, however, is where our responsiveness ends. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn5 \"\") The Status Report goes on to argue that we cannot expound on what the Commission’s future plans might be in the event the rulemaking petitions are denied, because we would be “prejudging” those policy decisions. [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn6 \"\") And, the Status Report explains, any future rulemaking should benefit from a court ruling on our statutory authority. [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn7 \"\") We also weigh in on a number of questions that the Court did **_not_** ask of us – for example, we opine that there are “no obstacle\\[s\\]” to reaching the merits of the case and that a “live controversy” remains.

          "On April 24, 2025—three months ago—the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit directed the Commission to provide a status update in the ongoing litigation concerning the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules, which the Commission adopted in March of 2024. [\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn1 \"\") The Court “directed” the Commission to advise whether it “intends to review or reconsider the \\[R\\]ules at issue in this case.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn2 \"\") And, if the Commission has determined to take no action, the Court ordered the Commission to explain whether it “will adhere to the \\[R\\]ules if the petitions for review are denied and, if not, why it will not review or reconsider the \\[R\\]ules at this time.” [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn3 \"\")",
          "The Court’s directive was straightforward; our answer is not. The Commission’s Status Report, filed today, states plainly enough that it has no intention of revisiting the Rules at this time. [\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn4 \"\") That, however, is where our responsiveness ends. [\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn5 \"\") The Status Report goes on to argue that we cannot expound on what the Commission’s future plans might be in the event the rulemaking petitions are denied, because we would be “prejudging” those policy decisions. [\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn6 \"\") And, the Status Report explains, any future rulemaking should benefit from a court ruling on our statutory authority. [\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn7 \"\") We also weigh in on a number of questions that the Court did **_not_** ask of us – for example, we opine that there are “no obstacle\\[s\\]” to reaching the merits of the case and that a “live controversy” remains.

It must engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking, with the benefit of economic analysis and a public, transparent process, even if inconvenient or if the Commission has other, more pressing priorities.

          "July 23, 2025\n\nOn April 24, 2025—three months ago—the U.S",
          "Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit directed the Commission to provide a status update in the ongoing litigation concerning the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules, which the Commission adopted in March of 2024",
          "[\\[1\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn1 \"\") The Court “directed” the Commission to advise whether it “intends to review or reconsider the \\[R\\]ules at issue in this case.” [\\[2\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn2 \"\") And, if the Commission has determined to take no action, the Court ordered the Commission to explain whether it “will adhere to the \\[R\\]ules if the petitions for review are denied and, if not, why it will not review or reconsider the \\[R\\]ules at this time.” [\\[3\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn3 \"\")\n\nThe Court’s directive was straightforward; our answer is not",
          "The Commission’s Status Report, filed today, states plainly enough that it has no intention of revisiting the Rules at this time",
          "[\\[4\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn4 \"\") That, however, is where our responsiveness ends",
          "[\\[5\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn5 \"\") The Status Report goes on to argue that we cannot expound on what the Commission’s future plans might be in the event the rulemaking petitions are denied, because we would be “prejudging” those policy decisions",
          "[\\[6\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn6 \"\") And, the Status Report explains, any future rulemaking should benefit from a court ruling on our statutory authority",
          "[\\[7\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn7 \"\") We also weigh in on a number of questions that the Court did **_not_** ask of us – for example, we opine that there are “no obstacle\\[s\\]” to reaching the merits of the case and that a “live controversy” remains",
          "[\\[8\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn8 \"\")\n\nThis purported response is wholly unresponsive",
          "The Court asked us in no uncertain terms “will \\[the Commission\\] adhere to the \\[R\\]ules if the petitions for review are denied\\[?\\]” We did not—but should have—answered that question",
          "The unspoken truth under this Commission is that the answer is “no.” Three of the four current Commissioners have been vocal critics of the Rules",
          "[\\[9\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn9 \"\") They have also withdrawn the Commission from the defense of the Rules in litigation",
          "[\\[10\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn10 \"\") The Commission simply does not want to say what we all know to be true by now—it has no intention of allowing the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules to go into effect",
          "Once we acknowledge this answer, the rest of the Commission’s arguments fall away",
          "There are no prejudgment issues, because there is nothing to prejudge",
          "And, we do not need the Court to rule on our statutory authority for the Commission to engage in rulemaking",
          "If there is future rulemaking in this space—whether to rescind the Rules or otherwise **–** that rulemaking may present different legal issues",
          "Whatever those issues may be, and whomever those aggrieved parties may be, they are not now before the Court",
          "Federal courts are not in the business of giving advisory opinions to agencies",
          "What is crystal clear, however, is that this Commission is seeking to avoid its legal obligations under the guise of conserving “Commission time and resources.” No matter what, this comes at the expense of judicial resources",
          "As I wrote previously in connection with the Commission’s decision to stop defending these Rules, [\\[11\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn11 \"\") the Administrative Procedure Act governs the process by which we make and repeal rules",
          "It includes a prescriptive framework for promulgation and rescission",
          "If this Commission wants to rescind, repeal or modify the Rules, which were promulgated by-the-book, then it must do the statutorily-required work",
          "It cannot take the easy way out",
          "It must engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking, with the benefit of economic analysis and a public, transparent process, even if inconvenient or if the Commission has other, more pressing priorities",
          "[\\[12\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn12 \"\") Indeed, other Commissioners have acknowledged that doing the work required to rescind the rule would be a difficult lift",
          "[\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325#_ftn13 \"\") So, instead, we once again ask the Court to do the work for us",
          "By asking the Court to carry water that we should shoulder ourselves, we do a grave disservice to our already taxed judicial system",
          "This is not good governance",
          "The Commission has effectively ignored the Court’s order and thrown the ball back at the Court",
          "The Court should decline to play these games",

As I keep telling my team, the changes you will see emerge from the Securities and Exchange Commission by way of the Division of Corporation Finance (the “Division”) will be the equivalent of a series of blockbuster movies, reminiscent of Spielberg’s greatest hits. He may have already taken the perfect title for one of our movies, but you can expect our very own “disclosure day” releases. And while Spielberg and I have very different plots in mind for our productions, I promise you that our releases will be just as thrilling. It’s time to leave some of these burdensome regulations on the cutting room floor. I rejoined the Commission’s staff a few short months ago after nearly a quarter century in private practice, ready to implement Chairman Paul Atkins’ sweeping agenda to return the agency to its core mission of protecting investors and facilitating capital formation. The intent of his agenda is to reduce barriers to going public, rationalize burdensome requirements while ensuring that investors continue to have access to the material information they need, and simplify and modernize our rules so that more companies are willing to go and stay public. The Division will play a starring role in executing that agenda. Just take a look at the long list of Division rulemakings on the Regulatory Flexibility Agenda.[[2]](#_ftn2) The Division staff is currently working on advancing our rulemakings as quickly as possible. In line with the Chairman’s priorities, we are first focusing on crypto assets reform, implementing the Holding Foreign Insiders Accountable Act (“HFIAA”) to require Section 16 reporting for Foreign Private Issuers (“FPIs”) as mandated by Congress, creating an option for semi-annual, rather than quarterly, reporting, and reducing regulatory burdens from Regulation S-K, including executive compensation disclosures. ### Crypto Assets\n\nLast year, then-Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda referenced Spielberg’s first blockbuster, *Jaws*,in his remarks at the SEC Speaks conference.[[3]](#_ftn3) He described a dangerous sea with the ever-lurking threat of regulation by enforcement. In the prior administration, nowhere was that more evident than in crypto assets enforcement. Two of the Division’s blockbuster recommendations headed to the Commission will focus on crypto assets. Last November, Chairman Atkins outlined the next steps for “Project Crypto,” which he expects will provide a clear taxonomy for crypto assets and guidance on when crypto assets are no longer part of, or subject to, an investment contract.[[4]](#_ftn4) The Division is preparing to deliver these recommendations to the Commission in the form of interpretive guidance that provides a taxonomy for crypto assets and describes a framework for determining when crypto assets are subject to an investment contract. For those crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract, we are also working on a proposal that will seek to provide a rational regulatory structure for the offer and sale of those securities. Following these big releases, the markets will no doubt continue to innovate. You’ve seen that the Division has been willing to jump in and has provided needed market clarity through Division statements and no-action letters.[[5]](#_ftn5) We will continue to monitor the marketplace and provide additional guidance as needed to further facilitate capital formation and accommodate innovation in this space without sacrificing investor protection. ### Regulation S-K\n\nSecurities lawyers from the early days of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would want to “phone home” if they were transported, *E.T.*-style, to witness today’s disclosure regime. The overall length of proxy statements and periodic filings – not to mention compliance costs – have skyrocketed over the past decades, creating massive documents that would be alien to those who created our disclosure regime. To invigorate the process of right-sizing these disclosures, the Chairman recently put out a statement instructing the Division to review Regulation S-K with the goal of “revising the requirements to focus on eliciting disclosure of material information and avoid compelling the disclosure of immaterial information.”[[6]](#_ftn6) The Chairman’s statement requested public comment on any part of Regulation S-K, following upon the informative Executive Compensation Roundtable and related request for comment last year focused on Item 402 of Regulation S-K.[[7]](#_ftn7) Companies, investors, and other market participants now have the unique opportunity to help us draft the scripts for the next several sequels. We have plenty of long academic letters about the principles of disclosure, but we are looking for targeted, concrete recommendations to reduce immaterial disclosure and encourage companies to focus on the information that is material to investors. The Division can especially use data, including but not limited to the cost of compliance with specific SEC rules. Go ahead and mark up the reg text itself – we aren’t afraid of some red ink on our script. Please feel free to submit your comments on Regulation S-X as well. ### Semi-Annual Reporting\n\nIt may feel as though we’re still stuck in *The Terminal*with semi-annual reporting. President Trump initially called for an end to quarterly reporting in a social media post in 2018, and the SEC followed up with a request for comment, but unfortunately nothing materialized at the time.[[8]](#_ftn8) In September 2025, the President again called for a reconsideration of mandatory quarterly reporting. This time, however, I expect things will be different. Chairman Atkins has asked us to prioritize this proposal.[[9]](#_ftn9) It’s time to leave the airport at last and travel forward with a formal rulemaking. As we prepare recommendations for the Commission, we will be considering what other rule changes may be needed to ensure any transition to a semi-annual reporting process will be smooth and free from any regulatory turbulence. Like selecting the perfect travel snack once in the air, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. For some companies and their investors, semi-annual reporting may make sense. Other companies, however, may have reasons why quarterly reporting still works best for them. We want to hear a broad range of market participants’ thoughts on the best way to structure the final rule before making the Division’s ultimate recommendation to the Commission. If you have any data (including from other jurisdictions) on the possible effects of changing the reporting cycle, please send us that information through the comment process once a rule proposal is out. ### HFIAA and Concept Releases\n\nAs in *Indiana Jones*, distant foreign lands offer unexpected changes, excitement, and adventure. As part of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress passed the HFIAA. The HFIAA subjects the directors and officers of reporting FPIs to the SEC’s insider transaction reporting regime and mandates that the SEC implement any necessary rule changes by March 18, 2026.[[10]](#_ftn10) Unlike some of the mazes that challenged the intrepid explorer Indiana Jones, Congress gave us a clear map to guide us for what needs to be done in short order. And, like Indy, we are racing ahead of a rolling boulder – in this case, the March 18, 2026, deadline to complete the mandated rulemaking. The Division is working to get its rulemaking recommendations to the Commission ahead of the deadline. Still, it’s important to keep in mind that the Exchange Act Section 16(a) amendments made by the HFIAA are self-executing, so, regardless of the rulemaking’s status, officers and directors of reporting FPIs must comply with the Section 16(a) reporting obligations beginning March 18, 2026. Our EDGAR Business Office recently put out a message recommending that directors and officers of FPIs request their filer identification numbers early so that there are not thousands of requests rushing in right before the deadline comes crashing down.[[11]](#_ftn11) The HFIAA gave the Commission the authority to exempt directors and officers of reporting FPIs in jurisdictions in which the applicable foreign law requirements are “substantially similar” to Section 16(a). Division staff is analyzing the laws of foreign jurisdictions and may make recommendations to the Commission in this area. FPIs also have a starring role in our June 2025 Concept Release on Foreign Private Issuer Eligibility.[[12]](#_ftn12) The Division is processing the comments received thus far on that release. And don’t forget our September 2025 Concept Release on Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Disclosures and Enhancements to Asset-Backed Securities Registration.[[13]](#_ftn13) The comment period for that release recently closed and we’re wrapping up our review of comments received to date in preparation for making a recommendation to the Commission about a potential rule proposal. ### Staff Guidance and More\n\nDon’t expect a quiet summer ahead as we continue our work on an extensive overhaul of our rules to implement regulatory reform. Nowadays, in between the flashy blockbuster sequels, you can watch a steady stream of good shows that help move the plot along to keep pace with the market. Between the big rulemakings that I just described, we will be issuing staff-level guidance that will continue to help companies, their advisors, investors, and other market participants more efficiently navigate our rules. The Division has been putting out interpretive guidance and no-action letters on a variety of topics, including tender offers, broker searches, exempt proxy solicitations, spin-offs, crypto assets, and Section 13(d) group formation. You can expect to see even more staff guidance in the near future. We want to do what we can to assist registrants and smooth the path to capital formation without sacrificing investor protection. ### Disclosure Review\n\nSome movie franchises have a seemingly endless number of sequels and remakes. Our Disclosure Review Program’s prolific output dwarfs the number of *Jurassic Park* films. After receiving nearly 1,000 registration statements during the Fall 2025 government shutdown (with more flowing in after the shutdown ended), the Disclosure Review Program triaged filings and processed them as quickly as possible in the order received. Lapse times are still a bit longer than usual, but they are trending downward as the program resumes normal operations. I am proud of our updated shutdown guidance related to Rule 430A that allowed issuers greater flexibility with respect to pricing offerings that were filed without a delaying amendment.[[14]](#_ftn14) Some of these offerings went effective automatically after the passage of 20 days. Remember that you won’t see notices of effectiveness on EDGAR for registration statements that went automatically effective. Those notices are only issued when the staff declares a registration statement effective by delegated authority. There has also been a delay in posting comment letters due to the dig-out from the shutdown, so keep in mind that the number of letters and correspondence posted may not yet reflect what was actually finalized over the last few months. If you have any questions, your review team stands ready to assist. ### Shareholder Proposals\n\nSpeaking of sequels, the shareholder proposals task force is taking a much-needed break after decades of proxy proposal review seasons. The Division’s November statement pausing the task force due to resource constraints has led to a number of questions and practical approaches taken by proponents and companies alike.[[15]](#_ftn15) We have been doing a lot of outreach to companies, investors, and proxy advisors to answer questions and listen to concerns. We are seeing a mixed result so far, with over 150 no-objection letter requests received, while other proposals are included in company proxy statements. We aren’t putting a thumb on the outcome scale either way, so we aren’t surprised to see companies reaching different conclusions based on the details of the proposals, independent legal analysis, and their own business and risk assessments. A rulemaking to modernize the shareholder proposals rule is on the Commission’s agenda and the Division is in the process of preparing its recommendations. \\*\\*\\*\n\nUnder my leadership, there is an open-door policy in the Division. I invite companies, investors, and other market participants to tell us what’s working and what’s not, and where there are issues, please propose a solution. The Division is ready to usher in a new day for public companies and their investors. We need your ideas, suggestions, comments, and data to get there. Help us help you! Then grab a seat and your popcorn before the feature films start rolling. Exciting times lie ahead!\n\n---\n\n[[1]](#_ftnref1) This statement is provided in the author’s official capacity as the Commission’s Director of the Division of Corporation Finance but does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, Commissioners, or other members of the staff.

          "# Coming Attractions From the Division of Corporation Finance",
          "[James Moloney, Director, Division of Corporation Finance](/about/division-office-directors/james-moloney)",
          "*This statement describes, among other things, my remarks and other matters discussed by Duc Dang, Sebastian Gomez Abero, Jonathan Ingram, Heather Rosenberger, and Ted Yu during various presentations at the 2026 Securities Regulation Institute from January 26-28, 2026, in Coronado, California.*[*[1]*](#_ftn1)",
          "Steven Spielberg is directing a movie called *Disclosure Day*, coming this summer to a theater near you. As I keep telling my team, the changes you will see emerge from the Securities and Exchange Commission by way of the Division of Corporation Finance (the “Division”) will be the equivalent of a series of blockbuster movies, reminiscent of Spielberg’s greatest hits. He may have already taken the perfect title for one of our movies, but you can expect our very own “disclosure day” releases. And while Spielberg and I have very different plots in mind for our productions, I promise you that our releases will be just as thrilling. It’s time to leave some of these burdensome regulations on the cutting room floor. I rejoined the Commission’s staff a few short months ago after nearly a quarter century in private practice, ready to implement Chairman Paul Atkins’ sweeping agenda to return the agency to its core mission of protecting investors and facilitating capital formation. The intent of his agenda is to reduce barriers to going public, rationalize burdensome requirements while ensuring that investors continue to have access to the material information they need, and simplify and modernize our rules so that more companies are willing to go and stay public. The Division will play a starring role in executing that agenda. Just take a look at the long list of Division rulemakings on the Regulatory Flexibility Agenda.[[2]](#_ftn2) The Division staff is currently working on advancing our rulemakings as quickly as possible. In line with the Chairman’s priorities, we are first focusing on crypto assets reform, implementing the Holding Foreign Insiders Accountable Act (“HFIAA”) to require Section 16 reporting for Foreign Private Issuers (“FPIs”) as mandated by Congress, creating an option for semi-annual, rather than quarterly, reporting, and reducing regulatory burdens from Regulation S-K, including executive compensation disclosures. ### Crypto Assets",
          "Last year, then-Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda referenced Spielberg’s first blockbuster, *Jaws*,in his remarks at the SEC Speaks conference.[[3]](#_ftn3) He described a dangerous sea with the ever-lurking threat of regulation by enforcement. In the prior administration, nowhere was that more evident than in crypto assets enforcement. Two of the Division’s blockbuster recommendations headed to the Commission will focus on crypto assets. Last November, Chairman Atkins outlined the next steps for “Project Crypto,” which he expects will provide a clear taxonomy for crypto assets and guidance on when crypto assets are no longer part of, or subject to, an investment contract.[[4]](#_ftn4) The Division is preparing to deliver these recommendations to the Commission in the form of interpretive guidance that provides a taxonomy for crypto assets and describes a framework for determining when crypto assets are subject to an investment contract. For those crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract, we are also working on a proposal that will seek to provide a rational regulatory structure for the offer and sale of those securities. Following these big releases, the markets will no doubt continue to innovate. You’ve seen that the Division has been willing to jump in and has provided needed market clarity through Division statements and no-action letters.[[5]](#_ftn5) We will continue to monitor the marketplace and provide additional guidance as needed to further facilitate capital formation and accommodate innovation in this space without sacrificing investor protection. ### Regulation S-K",
          "Securities lawyers from the early days of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would want to “phone home” if they were transported, *E.T.*-style, to witness today’s disclosure regime. The overall length of proxy statements and periodic filings – not to mention compliance costs – have skyrocketed over the past decades, creating massive documents that would be alien to those who created our disclosure regime. To invigorate the process of right-sizing these disclosures, the Chairman recently put out a statement instructing the Division to review Regulation S-K with the goal of “revising the requirements to focus on eliciting disclosure of material information and avoid compelling the disclosure of immaterial information.”[[6]](#_ftn6) The Chairman’s statement requested public comment on any part of Regulation S-K, following upon the informative Executive Compensation Roundtable and related request for comment last year focused on Item 402 of Regulation S-K.[[7]](#_ftn7) Companies, investors, and other market participants now have the unique opportunity to help us draft the scripts for the next several sequels. We have plenty of long academic letters about the principles of disclosure, but we are looking for targeted, concrete recommendations to reduce immaterial disclosure and encourage companies to focus on the information that is material to investors. The Division can especially use data, including but not limited to the cost of compliance with specific SEC rules. Go ahead and mark up the reg text itself – we aren’t afraid of some red ink on our script. Please feel free to submit your comments on Regulation S-X as well. ### Semi-Annual Reporting",
          "It may feel as though we’re still stuck in *The Terminal*with semi-annual reporting. President Trump initially called for an end to quarterly reporting in a social media post in 2018, and the SEC followed up with a request for comment, but unfortunately nothing materialized at the time.[[8]](#_ftn8) In September 2025, the President again called for a reconsideration of mandatory quarterly reporting. This time, however, I expect things will be different. Chairman Atkins has asked us to prioritize this proposal.[[9]](#_ftn9) It’s time to leave the airport at last and travel forward with a formal rulemaking. As we prepare recommendations for the Commission, we will be considering what other rule changes may be needed to ensure any transition to a semi-annual reporting process will be smooth and free from any regulatory turbulence. Like selecting the perfect travel snack once in the air, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. For some companies and their investors, semi-annual reporting may make sense. Other companies, however, may have reasons why quarterly reporting still works best for them. We want to hear a broad range of market participants’ thoughts on the best way to structure the final rule before making the Division’s ultimate recommendation to the Commission. If you have any data (including from other jurisdictions) on the possible effects of changing the reporting cycle, please send us that information through the comment process once a rule proposal is out. ### HFIAA and Concept Releases",
          "As in *Indiana Jones*, distant foreign lands offer unexpected changes, excitement, and adventure. As part of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress passed the HFIAA. The HFIAA subjects the directors and officers of reporting FPIs to the SEC’s insider transaction reporting regime and mandates that the SEC implement any necessary rule changes by March 18, 2026.[[10]](#_ftn10) Unlike some of the mazes that challenged the intrepid explorer Indiana Jones, Congress gave us a clear map to guide us for what needs to be done in short order. And, like Indy, we are racing ahead of a rolling boulder – in this case, the March 18, 2026, deadline to complete the mandated rulemaking. The Division is working to get its rulemaking recommendations to the Commission ahead of the deadline. Still, it’s important to keep in mind that the Exchange Act Section 16(a) amendments made by the HFIAA are self-executing, so, regardless of the rulemaking’s status, officers and directors of reporting FPIs must comply with the Section 16(a) reporting obligations beginning March 18, 2026. Our EDGAR Business Office recently put out a message recommending that directors and officers of FPIs request their filer identification numbers early so that there are not thousands of requests rushing in right before the deadline comes crashing down.[[11]](#_ftn11) The HFIAA gave the Commission the authority to exempt directors and officers of reporting FPIs in jurisdictions in which the applicable foreign law requirements are “substantially similar” to Section 16(a). Division staff is analyzing the laws of foreign jurisdictions and may make recommendations to the Commission in this area. FPIs also have a starring role in our June 2025 Concept Release on Foreign Private Issuer Eligibility.[[12]](#_ftn12) The Division is processing the comments received thus far on that release. And don’t forget our September 2025 Concept Release on Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Disclosures and Enhancements to Asset-Backed Securities Registration.[[13]](#_ftn13) The comment period for that release recently closed and we’re wrapping up our review of comments received to date in preparation for making a recommendation to the Commission about a potential rule proposal. ### Staff Guidance and More",
          "Don’t expect a quiet summer ahead as we continue our work on an extensive overhaul of our rules to implement regulatory reform. Nowadays, in between the flashy blockbuster sequels, you can watch a steady stream of good shows that help move the plot along to keep pace with the market. Between the big rulemakings that I just described, we will be issuing staff-level guidance that will continue to help companies, their advisors, investors, and other market participants more efficiently navigate our rules. The Division has been putting out interpretive guidance and no-action letters on a variety of topics, including tender offers, broker searches, exempt proxy solicitations, spin-offs, crypto assets, and Section 13(d) group formation. You can expect to see even more staff guidance in the near future. We want to do what we can to assist registrants and smooth the path to capital formation without sacrificing investor protection. ### Disclosure Review",
          "Some movie franchises have a seemingly endless number of sequels and remakes. Our Disclosure Review Program’s prolific output dwarfs the number of *Jurassic Park* films. After receiving nearly 1,000 registration statements during the Fall 2025 government shutdown (with more flowing in after the shutdown ended), the Disclosure Review Program triaged filings and processed them as quickly as possible in the order received. Lapse times are still a bit longer than usual, but they are trending downward as the program resumes normal operations. I am proud of our updated shutdown guidance related to Rule 430A that allowed issuers greater flexibility with respect to pricing offerings that were filed without a delaying amendment.[[14]](#_ftn14) Some of these offerings went effective automatically after the passage of 20 days. Remember that you won’t see notices of effectiveness on EDGAR for registration statements that went automatically effective. Those notices are only issued when the staff declares a registration statement effective by delegated authority. There has also been a delay in posting comment letters due to the dig-out from the shutdown, so keep in mind that the number of letters and correspondence posted may not yet reflect what was actually finalized over the last few months. If you have any questions, your review team stands ready to assist. ### Shareholder Proposals",
          "Speaking of sequels, the shareholder proposals task force is taking a much-needed break after decades of proxy proposal review seasons. The Division’s November statement pausing the task force due to resource constraints has led to a number of questions and practical approaches taken by proponents and companies alike.[[15]](#_ftn15) We have been doing a lot of outreach to companies, investors, and proxy advisors to answer questions and listen to concerns. We are seeing a mixed result so far, with over 150 no-objection letter requests received, while other proposals are included in company proxy statements. We aren’t putting a thumb on the outcome scale either way, so we aren’t surprised to see companies reaching different conclusions based on the details of the proposals, independent legal analysis, and their own business and risk assessments. A rulemaking to modernize the shareholder proposals rule is on the Commission’s agenda and the Division is in the process of preparing its recommendations. \\*\\*\\*",
          "Under my leadership, there is an open-door policy in the Division. I invite companies, investors, and other market participants to tell us what’s working and what’s not, and where there are issues, please propose a solution. The Division is ready to usher in a new day for public companies and their investors. We need your ideas, suggestions, comments, and data to get there. Help us help you! Then grab a seat and your popcorn before the feature films start rolling. Exciting times lie ahead!",

          "The Division has been putting out interpretive guidance and no-action letters on a variety of topics, including tender offers, broker searches, exempt proxy solicitations, spin-offs, crypto assets, and Section 13(d) group formation",
          "You can expect to see even more staff guidance in the near future",
          "We want to do what we can to assist registrants and smooth the path to capital formation without sacrificing investor protection",
          "### Disclosure Review\n\nSome movie franchises have a seemingly endless number of sequels and remakes",
          "Our Disclosure Review Program’s prolific output dwarfs the number of *Jurassic Park* films",
          "After receiving nearly 1,000 registration statements during the Fall 2025 government shutdown (with more flowing in after the shutdown ended), the Disclosure Review Program triaged filings and processed them as quickly as possible in the order received",
          "Lapse times are still a bit longer than usual, but they are trending downward as the program resumes normal operations",
          "I am proud of our updated shutdown guidance related to Rule 430A that allowed issuers greater flexibility with respect to pricing offerings that were filed without a delaying amendment.[[14]](#_ftn14) Some of these offerings went effective automatically after the passage of 20 days",
          "Remember that you won’t see notices of effectiveness on EDGAR for registration statements that went automatically effective",
          "Those notices are only issued when the staff declares a registration statement effective by delegated authority",
          "There has also been a delay in posting comment letters due to the dig-out from the shutdown, so keep in mind that the number of letters and correspondence posted may not yet reflect what was actually finalized over the last few months",
          "If you have any questions, your review team stands ready to assist",
          "### Shareholder Proposals\n\nSpeaking of sequels, the shareholder proposals task force is taking a much-needed break after decades of proxy proposal review seasons",
          "The Division’s November statement pausing the task force due to resource constraints has led to a number of questions and practical approaches taken by proponents and companies alike.[[15]](#_ftn15) We have been doing a lot of outreach to companies, investors, and proxy advisors to answer questions and listen to concerns",
          "We are seeing a mixed result so far, with over 150 no-objection letter requests received, while other proposals are included in company proxy statements",
          "We aren’t putting a thumb on the outcome scale either way, so we aren’t surprised to see companies reaching different conclusions based on the details of the proposals, independent legal analysis, and their own business and risk assessments",
          "A rulemaking to modernize the shareholder proposals rule is on the Commission’s agenda and the Division is in the process of preparing its recommendations",
          "\\*\\*\\*\n\nUnder my leadership, there is an open-door policy in the Division",
          "I invite companies, investors, and other market participants to tell us what’s working and what’s not, and where there are issues, please propose a solution",
          "The Division is ready to usher in a new day for public companies and their investors",
          "We need your ideas, suggestions, comments, and data to get there",
          "Then grab a seat and your popcorn before the feature films start rolling",

        "full_text": "Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Warren, and Members of the Committee: It is an honor to testify before you today. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the work of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[[1]](#_ftn1) Nine months ago, I returned to the SEC with a clear mandate to recommit the agency to our core mission of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. I am grateful to work alongside dedicated public servants who have hit the ground running in pursuit of these priorities. America’s $124.3 trillion capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world, leading both in market capitalization and trading volume. They are a marvel of human ingenuity. Yet over the years, the federal government’s natural tendency has asserted itself, and rules have multiplied faster than the problems that they were intended to solve. This Congress and the Trump Administration are focused on bringing down the cost of living for the American people, and the SEC has a vital role to play. For example, public companies spend $2.7 billion a year to file their annual reports. This is $2.7 billion that companies are not reinvesting in their businesses to create jobs. $2.7 billion that our disclosure regime is diverting from your constituents to corporate lawyers, accountants, and consultants. Now, this is not to say that we want to gut corporate disclosure, which is vital. But we must modernize, rationalize, and streamline reports so that they are meaningful, understandable, and not a repellant to investors. After all, how many of you would read through an annual filing that rivals *War and Peace*? Disclosure documents of that length can do more to obscure than to illuminate. As I have stated previously, regulation ideally should be smart, effective, and appropriately tailored within the confines of our statutory authority. Instead, it has made the path to public ownership narrower, costlier, and saddled with rules that can create more friction than benefit. For context, shortly after I left the SEC in the mid-1990s, there were more than 7,800 companies listed on the U.S. exchanges. By the time that I returned as Chairman, that figure had fallen by roughly 40 percent.[[2]](#_ftn2) This trajectory tells a cautionary tale of regulatory creep that the SEC is working to rectify through the three pillars of my plan to make IPOs great again: first, re-anchoring disclosures in materiality so that investment decisions can turn on economic signals rather than on regulatory noise; second, de-politicizing shareholder meetings by restoring their focus to significant corporate matters; and third, allowing public companies to have litigation alternatives so that we shield innovators from the frivolous and investors from the fraudulent. I also applaud the bipartisan initiatives that you are considering in Congress, including those in the Senate’s Empowering Main Street in America Act and the House’s INVEST Act, to help keep America’s capital markets open, dynamic, and, above all, worthy of the trust that investors place in them. Of course, I also support congressional efforts to enact the CLARITY Act. Upon its passage, the Commission stands ready to implement this landmark legislation. A federal framework for crypto markets is long overdue. Under Commissioner Hester Peirce’s leadership of our Crypto Task Force, SEC staff has provided more clarity in the past year than in the prior decade, but there is no action we can take that future-proofs our rulebook more formidably than nonpartisan market structure legislation. As Congress completes its vital work, CFTC Chairman Mike Selig and I intend to provide a bridge toward legislation. Through our now-joint Project Crypto, we will consider a token taxonomy to offer both investors and innovators a clear understanding of their regulatory obligations. We will also look to consider exemptions that would allow market participants to move and transact on-chain. Now, as we modernize oversight for digital assets, we must also reassess whether our legacy tools for traditional markets remain appropriately aligned with regulatory need and the public interest, which brings me to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). I have directed SEC staff to conduct a comprehensive review of the CAT, which will consider, among other things, issues related to governance, funding, potential cost-savings measures (including potential retirement of duplicative systems), design, functionality, scope, regulatory use, and security. As the staff undertake this review, I note that the Commission has already taken steps to meaningfully reduce the costs of the CAT system which, when established in November 2016, estimated to total, at the upper end, about $55 million annually. Thanks in part to an amendment to the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission in 2024 and conditional exemptive relief issued by the Commission in 2025, we have reduced the originally-approved CAT budget for 2025—which included approximately $249 million in annual operating costs—by approximately $92 million over the course of the year. The Commission has also recently approved amendments to the CAT NMS Plan with respect to the Customer and Account Information System that self-regulatory organizations (SROs) state would result in an approximately $7-9 million in cost savings annually. In addition, the SROs recently proposed further amendments to the CAT NMS Plan to implement certain measures that would further reduce costs significantly. Those cost reductions reflect the SEC’s broader commitment to disciplined oversight across our regulatory ecosystem. In January 2026, for example, the SEC approved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) budget, totaling $362.1 million—a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year, including a 52 percent and 42 percent reduction in the Chairman’s and other Board members’ compensation, respectively. As the SEC and the PCAOB often work closely on matters important to our capital markets, I am also pleased that the Commission recently appointed new Board members who bring a wide variety of experiences to their service. When we began the search process, I highlighted the role that the PCAOB plays in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public companies through oversight of auditing firms, and thus the broader public markets, in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies and broker-dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB’s budget. The newly appointed Chairman and Board Members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service. The Chairman has extensive experience in management of a large organization and examinations work. I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB—one of sensible, more effective, and more efficient oversight of auditors. Finally, and most fundamentally, capital markets thrive on many factors, but they endure on the trust of those who participate in them. Investor protection is at the core of what brings us to work each day. And to fulfill that charge, the SEC is returning its enforcement program to first principles of rooting out fraud and remedying investor harm. Since I rejoined the Commission last year, we have brought enforcement actions to address offering frauds, insider trading, accounting and financial frauds, and breaches of fiduciary duty by investment advisers. In the fall, meanwhile, we announced the Division of Enforcement’s Cross-Border Task Force to strengthen and enhance our efforts to identify and combat cross-border fraud. Since September, we have suspended trading in the stocks of fourteen Asia-based issuers on evidence of potential manipulation designed to artificially inflate the price and volume of the securities. I am working within the securities laws to protect investors from those who seek to use international borders to evade and undermine U.S. investor protections. Markets are global. Investor protection must be as well. As I said at the outset of this testimony, the SEC is returning to a core mission that remains as vital today as it was when Congress first set it for us over 90 years ago. So, I want to thank this Committee once again for convening today’s hearing. I look forward to answering your questions and to our shared work ahead. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n[[1]](#_ftn1) The views expressed in this testimony are those of the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and do not necessarily represent the views of the President, the full Commission, or any Commissioner.\n\n[[2]](#_ftn2) As of September 30, 2025, there were 4,761 exchange-listed companies.",

Since September, we have suspended trading in the stocks of fourteen Asia-based issuers on evidence of potential manipulation designed to artificially inflate the price and volume of the securities. I am working within the securities laws to protect investors from those who seek to use international borders to evade and undermine U.S. investor protections. Markets are global. Investor protection must be as well. As I said at the outset of this testimony, the SEC is returning to a core mission that remains as vital today as it was when Congress first set it for us over 90 years ago. So, I want to thank this Committee once again for convening today’s hearing. I look forward to answering your questions and to our shared work ahead. Thank you.",

          "I am grateful to work alongside dedicated public servants who have hit the ground running in pursuit of these priorities",
          "America’s $124.3 trillion capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world, leading both in market capitalization and trading volume",
          "They are a marvel of human ingenuity",
          "Yet over the years, the federal government’s natural tendency has asserted itself, and rules have multiplied faster than the problems that they were intended to solve",
          "This Congress and the Trump Administration are focused on bringing down the cost of living for the American people, and the SEC has a vital role to play",
          "For example, public companies spend $2.7 billion a year to file their annual reports",
          "This is $2.7 billion that companies are not reinvesting in their businesses to create jobs",
          "$2.7 billion that our disclosure regime is diverting from your constituents to corporate lawyers, accountants, and consultants",
          "Now, this is not to say that we want to gut corporate disclosure, which is vital",
          "But we must modernize, rationalize, and streamline reports so that they are meaningful, understandable, and not a repellant to investors",
          "After all, how many of you would read through an annual filing that rivals *War and Peace*",
          "Disclosure documents of that length can do more to obscure than to illuminate",
          "As I have stated previously, regulation ideally should be smart, effective, and appropriately tailored within the confines of our statutory authority",
          "Instead, it has made the path to public ownership narrower, costlier, and saddled with rules that can create more friction than benefit",
          "For context, shortly after I left the SEC in the mid-1990s, there were more than 7,800 companies listed on the U.S",
          "By the time that I returned as Chairman, that figure had fallen by roughly 40 percent.[[2]](#_ftn2) This trajectory tells a cautionary tale of regulatory creep that the SEC is working to rectify through the three pillars of my plan to make IPOs great again: first, re-anchoring disclosures in materiality so that investment decisions can turn on economic signals rather than on regulatory noise; second, de-politicizing shareholder meetings by restoring their focus to significant corporate matters; and third, allowing public companies to have litigation alternatives so that we shield innovators from the frivolous and investors from the fraudulent",
          "I also applaud the bipartisan initiatives that you are considering in Congress, including those in the Senate’s Empowering Main Street in America Act and the House’s INVEST Act, to help keep America’s capital markets open, dynamic, and, above all, worthy of the trust that investors place in them",
          "Of course, I also support congressional efforts to enact the CLARITY Act",
          "Upon its passage, the Commission stands ready to implement this landmark legislation",
          "A federal framework for crypto markets is long overdue",
          "Under Commissioner Hester Peirce’s leadership of our Crypto Task Force, SEC staff has provided more clarity in the past year than in the prior decade, but there is no action we can take that future-proofs our rulebook more formidably than nonpartisan market structure legislation",
          "As Congress completes its vital work, CFTC Chairman Mike Selig and I intend to provide a bridge toward legislation",
          "Through our now-joint Project Crypto, we will consider a token taxonomy to offer both investors and innovators a clear understanding of their regulatory obligations",
          "We will also look to consider exemptions that would allow market participants to move and transact on-chain",
          "Now, as we modernize oversight for digital assets, we must also reassess whether our legacy tools for traditional markets remain appropriately aligned with regulatory need and the public interest, which brings me to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT)",
          "I have directed SEC staff to conduct a comprehensive review of the CAT, which will consider, among other things, issues related to governance, funding, potential cost-savings measures (including potential retirement of duplicative systems), design, functionality, scope, regulatory use, and security",
          "As the staff undertake this review, I note that the Commission has already taken steps to meaningfully reduce the costs of the CAT system which, when established in November 2016, estimated to total, at the upper end, about $55 million annually",
          "Thanks in part to an amendment to the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission in 2024 and conditional exemptive relief issued by the Commission in 2025, we have reduced the originally-approved CAT budget for 2025—which included approximately $249 million in annual operating costs—by approximately $92 million over the course of the year",
          "The Commission has also recently approved amendments to the CAT NMS Plan with respect to the Customer and Account Information System that self-regulatory organizations (SROs) state would result in an approximately $7-9 million in cost savings annually",
          "In addition, the SROs recently proposed further amendments to the CAT NMS Plan to implement certain measures that would further reduce costs significantly",
          "Those cost reductions reflect the SEC’s broader commitment to disciplined oversight across our regulatory ecosystem",
          "In January 2026, for example, the SEC approved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) budget, totaling $362.1 million—a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year, including a 52 percent and 42 percent reduction in the Chairman’s and other Board members’ compensation, respectively",
          "As the SEC and the PCAOB often work closely on matters important to our capital markets, I am also pleased that the Commission recently appointed new Board members who bring a wide variety of experiences to their service",
          "When we began the search process, I highlighted the role that the PCAOB plays in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public companies through oversight of auditing firms, and thus the broader public markets, in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies and broker-dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB’s budget",
          "The newly appointed Chairman and Board Members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service",
          "The Chairman has extensive experience in management of a large organization and examinations work",
          "I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB—one of sensible, more effective, and more efficient oversight of auditors",
          "Finally, and most fundamentally, capital markets thrive on many factors, but they endure on the trust of those who participate in them",
          "Investor protection is at the core of what brings us to work each day",
          "And to fulfill that charge, the SEC is returning its enforcement program to first principles of rooting out fraud and remedying investor harm",
          "Since I rejoined the Commission last year, we have brought enforcement actions to address offering frauds, insider trading, accounting and financial frauds, and breaches of fiduciary duty by investment advisers",

        "full_text": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Michele (Layne). And thank you to the organizers of this important conference for the invitation to speak to you today. Having now spent several months as its Director, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the direction in which the SEC’s Division of Enforcement is headed – a topic I know is of particular interest to this group. Before I begin, however, please note that my remarks today are made in my official capacity as the Director of the Division of Enforcement and may not reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff. ## Background\n\nBefore I dive into the Division’s current priorities, I’d like to take a step back. My legal career has been profoundly defined by public service: in the Marine Corps, as a law clerk, and on the bench. I see my current role as a continuation of this commitment to public service. As I told the Division staff in my first week on the job, I did not seek the role of Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. Rather, this role found me. And for that, I am grateful to have the opportunity to assist Chairman Atkins in righting the ship from some of the excesses of the prior administration. And I’m grateful for the opportunity to make my first public remarks here today, because I want to share with you my guiding principles as Director, how those principles relate to the Division’s process and priorities – which we are continuously evaluating and always looking to improve – and why I believe these principles complement those of Chairman Atkins.\n\nSo, principles, process, priorities.\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\nI haven’t been leading the Division long, but I’ve been here long enough to see and admire the deep technical expertise held by both the Commission staff and the securities bar, developed and nurtured over the last ninety-plus years. With that context, however, I offer that my guiding principles as the Director are no different than those which have guided me as a Marine, as a law clerk, and as a judge. Namely, integrity, honor, fidelity to the law, and an unwavering commitment to the fair and judicious use of the formidable power and resources the federal government has entrusted to me. To quote Spiderman, with great power comes great responsibility. I believe these principles mirror the Chairman’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring fair process to all those who participate in and benefit from our capital markets. And, under his leadership, it is a true privilege to lead my extraordinarily talented staff as they animate these principles every day. Now, I am acutely aware of the criticisms of how the Division operated in the past, some of which I think are valid and warranted course correction. But I will not let the Division be weighed down by criticism that is misinformed, has been remedied, or only exists as historical artifact. Our mission – of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation – is too important.\n\nSo today, I will discuss two primary topics: process and priorities. ## Process\n\nI want to start with an aspect of our work that is important to me as well as to Chairman Atkins: the process the Division provides to those involved in enforcement investigations. The Division of Enforcement is committed to providing transparent and appropriate process to individuals and to companies under investigation by Enforcement. One of the ways we demonstrate this commitment is by adhering to the Wells process, which is a mechanism through which the enforcement staff notifies potential defendants or respondents of charges – and the basis for those charges – in advance of recommending the Commission authorize those charges.  The proposed defendant or respondent now has a four-week window to make a submission explaining why the Commission should not authorize an enforcement action, stating their position on the merits. This is a meaningful opportunity for Wells recipients to address key issues of fact or law before an enforcement recommendation is made. Wells recipients are also typically granted the opportunity to meet with Division leadership to “make their case.” This is a very meaningful opportunity. As a judge, I recognize the virtue of an adversarial system and its propensity to reveal the right conclusion, and to get to the truth. As the Director I see that virtue in the Wells process. By facilitating an open, informed, and thoughtful dialogue between staff and parties under investigation, we not only provide transparency and a fair opportunity to respond, but we also receive the benefits of zealous advocacy regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the case. This ensures that, before taking the significant step of recommending an enforcement action, a recommendation which will have real effects on individuals and businesses while occupying significant enforcement resources, we – and the Commission – have considered a more fully-developed record and put ourselves in the best possible position to “get it right.” A member of the enforcement senior leadership team will attend every Wells meeting, and I can assure you that all Wells submissions will be read and carefully considered. And, as Chairman Atkins recently noted, the Commission also receives the submissions and is expected to read them – and I am convinced that they do. A compelling Wells submission can and may make a difference both at the enforcement recommendation stage and when the Commission is determining how to vote on an enforcement recommendation.\n\nBut this process only works if both sides engage fairly and in good faith. I thus emphasize one final point with respect to process. As I’ve described, I believe the Division’s process is both transparent and fair. But I would advise those in the defense bar not to mistake fairness for weakness. Recognize that the staff is seeking to move expeditiously, and to reach conclusions and make recommendations within reasonable time periods to uphold our obligations as public servants. At the same time, we are committed to professional courtesy, consideration, and – where we can – flexibility. Deliberate circumvention of the process, however, including tactical tardiness and other games, will not be tolerated. Make no mistake, counsels’ incentives, financial or otherwise, to prolong an investigation (and then complain about how long the investigation took) will be met by steadfast commitment to reasonable and timely resolution.\n\nI will hold my staff, and you, to that standard.\n\n## Enforcement Priorities\n\nNow that I’ve laid the foundation of process, let’s move to my priorities for the Enforcement Division, which, again, are informed by the Chairman’s views and our historic emphasis. First and foremost. The Enforcement Division remains focused on its mission to vigorously enforce federal securities laws in accordance with the Chairman’s focus on returning to the basics, with fairness and a focus on timely resolution of cases. The Division’s dedication to this purpose not only protects investors, but preserves fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitates capital formation – the very mandates of the agency itself.  In my time as head of the Division, I can attest that the staff are truly doing good work on behalf of the American people. The office brims with bright, mission-driven lawyers, analysts, and accountants – professionals in every sense of the word – who remain committed to our mission. Fraud in our capital markets persists, and so does my staff as they work to eliminate it. Put another way – reports that enforcement work at the SEC has been tossed to the wayside are not only greatly exaggerated but flat out wrong. But I will say that I am far more concerned with the quality and impact of the enforcement actions that we bring than with chasing numbers. And the reality is that I do not have unlimited resources at my disposal. As such, I focus on using the resources we have judiciously – that is, where they can most effectively and fairly be used to protect investors and our capital markets. This entails continuous review and monitoring of our docket to ensure we deploy our resources efficiently and refocus our priorities at the direction of the Commission. Put simply, we have focused and will continue to focus on bringing good cases that further the SEC’s core mission. Second. A principal focus of our enforcement program is thus to protect investors from the myriad fraud schemes cooked up by bad actors, which Chairman Atkins refers to as the liars, cheats, and thieves. Identifying, rooting out, and remedying scams, particularly those that inflict devastating costs on everyday retail investors, is the cornerstone of what we do. Our work will continue to focus on uncovering and deterring fraud that wipes out American investors’ retirement savings, or fraud that undercuts their progress towards saving for a home, or their kids’ education. And we will make full use of the remedies available to return money to investors harmed by those frauds. Likewise, we will continue to charge violations of the securities laws for misconduct that clearly undermines market integrity, including accounting fraud, insider trading, wash trading, and market manipulation schemes. This critical work ensures that appropriate market forces, not bad actors, determine the value of securities. Third, and lastly, I want to spend some time talking about compliance with other provisions of our federal securities laws, such as a public company’s reporting requirements; its obligations to maintain adequate books and records and devise and maintain systems of internal accounting controls; or a broker-dealer or investment adviser’s obligation to adhere to its fiduciary duties and financial responsibility rules. Whether a requirement is in a statute or promulgated using the Commission’s rulemaking authority, enforcement of such rules is necessary to maintain the fairness of our capital markets. Are violations of these provisions on par with fraud? No, not necessarily. In fact, I am confident that many violations of these provisions should not – and do not – result in enforcement cases by the Commission. But there is a middle ground: where fraud is absent, but compliance has failed in a way that poses risks to investors, risks to the integrity of the market, or yields a benefit to the participant. It is a place that may warrant enforcement action but may also present opportunity. Opportunity for both the Division and those who might be subject to an enforcement action to craft thoughtful resolutions in an appropriate case – resolutions that recognize wrongdoing while rectifying the violation or charting a firmer path toward compliance. Because – at the end of the day – our work in this space is about ensuring participants in our capital markets are providing investors with the necessary information and operating within the guardrails that make our capital markets the envy of the world. Where other divisions can identify, educate, and help people and entities remediate the problem or deficiency, fantastic. ## Conclusion\n\nI’ll end with this: in a perfect world, we wouldn’t need a Division of Enforcement because we wouldn’t have violations of our securities laws. But we do not live in a perfect world. Wrongdoing exists. And so long as it does, I am honored to help steer the ship – using the guiding principles I have described, and with careful and thoughtful stewardship of the formidable resources and power the federal government has entrusted to me – on behalf of those that rely on and participate in our capital markets.\n\nThank you for your time and attention. I look forward to the discussion to follow. Thank you.",

          "My legal career has been profoundly defined by public service: in the Marine Corps, as a law clerk, and on the bench",
          "I see my current role as a continuation of this commitment to public service",
          "As I told the Division staff in my first week on the job, I did not seek the role of Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division",
          "Rather, this role found me",
          "And for that, I am grateful to have the opportunity to assist Chairman Atkins in righting the ship from some of the excesses of the prior administration",
          "And I’m grateful for the opportunity to make my first public remarks here today, because I want to share with you my guiding principles as Director, how those principles relate to the Division’s process and priorities – which we are continuously evaluating and always looking to improve – and why I believe these principles complement those of Chairman Atkins",
          "So, principles, process, priorities",
          "## Guiding Principles\n\nI haven’t been leading the Division long, but I’ve been here long enough to see and admire the deep technical expertise held by both the Commission staff and the securities bar, developed and nurtured over the last ninety-plus years",
          "With that context, however, I offer that my guiding principles as the Director are no different than those which have guided me as a Marine, as a law clerk, and as a judge",
          "Namely, integrity, honor, fidelity to the law, and an unwavering commitment to the fair and judicious use of the formidable power and resources the federal government has entrusted to me",
          "To quote Spiderman, with great power comes great responsibility",
          "I believe these principles mirror the Chairman’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring fair process to all those who participate in and benefit from our capital markets",
          "And, under his leadership, it is a true privilege to lead my extraordinarily talented staff as they animate these principles every day",
          "Now, I am acutely aware of the criticisms of how the Division operated in the past, some of which I think are valid and warranted course correction",
          "But I will not let the Division be weighed down by criticism that is misinformed, has been remedied, or only exists as historical artifact",
          "Our mission – of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation – is too important",
          "So today, I will discuss two primary topics: process and priorities",
          "## Process\n\nI want to start with an aspect of our work that is important to me as well as to Chairman Atkins: the process the Division provides to those involved in enforcement investigations",
          "The Division of Enforcement is committed to providing transparent and appropriate process to individuals and to companies under investigation by Enforcement",
          "One of the ways we demonstrate this commitment is by adhering to the Wells process, which is a mechanism through which the enforcement staff notifies potential defendants or respondents of charges – and the basis for those charges – in advance of recommending the Commission authorize those charges",
          "The proposed defendant or respondent now has a four-week window to make a submission explaining why the Commission should not authorize an enforcement action, stating their position on the merits",
          "This is a meaningful opportunity for Wells recipients to address key issues of fact or law before an enforcement recommendation is made",
          "Wells recipients are also typically granted the opportunity to meet with Division leadership to “make their case.” This is a very meaningful opportunity",
          "As a judge, I recognize the virtue of an adversarial system and its propensity to reveal the right conclusion, and to get to the truth",
          "As the Director I see that virtue in the Wells process",
          "By facilitating an open, informed, and thoughtful dialogue between staff and parties under investigation, we not only provide transparency and a fair opportunity to respond, but we also receive the benefits of zealous advocacy regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the case",
          "This ensures that, before taking the significant step of recommending an enforcement action, a recommendation which will have real effects on individuals and businesses while occupying significant enforcement resources, we – and the Commission – have considered a more fully-developed record and put ourselves in the best possible position to “get it right.” A member of the enforcement senior leadership team will attend every Wells meeting, and I can assure you that all Wells submissions will be read and carefully considered",
          "And, as Chairman Atkins recently noted, the Commission also receives the submissions and is expected to read them – and I am convinced that they do",
          "A compelling Wells submission can and may make a difference both at the enforcement recommendation stage and when the Commission is determining how to vote on an enforcement recommendation",
          "But this process only works if both sides engage fairly and in good faith",
          "I thus emphasize one final point with respect to process",
          "As I’ve described, I believe the Division’s process is both transparent and fair",
          "But I would advise those in the defense bar not to mistake fairness for weakness",
          "Recognize that the staff is seeking to move expeditiously, and to reach conclusions and make recommendations within reasonable time periods to uphold our obligations as public servants",
          "At the same time, we are committed to professional courtesy, consideration, and – where we can – flexibility",
          "Deliberate circumvention of the process, however, including tactical tardiness and other games, will not be tolerated",
          "Make no mistake, counsels’ incentives, financial or otherwise, to prolong an investigation (and then complain about how long the investigation took) will be met by steadfast commitment to reasonable and timely resolution",
          "I will hold my staff, and you, to that standard",
          "## Enforcement Priorities\n\nNow that I’ve laid the foundation of process, let’s move to my priorities for the Enforcement Division, which, again, are informed by the Chairman’s views and our historic emphasis",
          "The Enforcement Division remains focused on its mission to vigorously enforce federal securities laws in accordance with the Chairman’s focus on returning to the basics, with fairness and a focus on timely resolution of cases",
          "The Division’s dedication to this purpose not only protects investors, but preserves fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitates capital formation – the very mandates of the agency itself",
          "In my time as head of the Division, I can attest that the staff are truly doing good work on behalf of the American people",
          "The office brims with bright, mission-driven lawyers, analysts, and accountants – professionals in every sense of the word – who remain committed to our mission",
          "Fraud in our capital markets persists, and so does my staff as they work to eliminate it",
          "Put another way – reports that enforcement work at the SEC has been tossed to the wayside are not only greatly exaggerated but flat out wrong",
          "But I will say that I am far more concerned with the quality and impact of the enforcement actions that we bring than with chasing numbers",
          "And the reality is that I do not have unlimited resources at my disposal",
          "As such, I focus on using the resources we have judiciously – that is, where they can most effectively and fairly be used to protect investors and our capital markets",
          "This entails continuous review and monitoring of our docket to ensure we deploy our resources efficiently and refocus our priorities at the direction of the Commission",
          "Put simply, we have focused and will continue to focus on bringing good cases that further the SEC’s core mission",
          "A principal focus of our enforcement program is thus to protect investors from the myriad fraud schemes cooked up by bad actors, which Chairman Atkins refers to as the liars, cheats, and thieves",
          "Identifying, rooting out, and remedying scams, particularly those that inflict devastating costs on everyday retail investors, is the cornerstone of what we do",
          "Our work will continue to focus on uncovering and deterring fraud that wipes out American investors’ retirement savings, or fraud that undercuts their progress towards saving for a home, or their kids’ education",
          "And we will make full use of the remedies available to return money to investors harmed by those frauds",
          "Likewise, we will continue to charge violations of the securities laws for misconduct that clearly undermines market integrity, including accounting fraud, insider trading, wash trading, and market manipulation schemes",
          "This critical work ensures that appropriate market forces, not bad actors, determine the value of securities",
          "Third, and lastly, I want to spend some time talking about compliance with other provisions of our federal securities laws, such as a public company’s reporting requirements; its obligations to maintain adequate books and records and devise and maintain systems of internal accounting controls; or a broker-dealer or investment adviser’s obligation to adhere to its fiduciary duties and financial responsibility rules",
          "Whether a requirement is in a statute or promulgated using the Commission’s rulemaking authority, enforcement of such rules is necessary to maintain the fairness of our capital markets",
          "Are violations of these provisions on par with fraud",
          "In fact, I am confident that many violations of these provisions should not – and do not – result in enforcement cases by the Commission",
          "But there is a middle ground: where fraud is absent, but compliance has failed in a way that poses risks to investors, risks to the integrity of the market, or yields a benefit to the participant",
          "It is a place that may warrant enforcement action but may also present opportunity",
          "Opportunity for both the Division and those who might be subject to an enforcement action to craft thoughtful resolutions in an appropriate case – resolutions that recognize wrongdoing while rectifying the violation or charting a firmer path toward compliance",
          "Because – at the end of the day – our work in this space is about ensuring participants in our capital markets are providing investors with the necessary information and operating within the guardrails that make our capital markets the envy of the world",
          "Where other divisions can identify, educate, and help people and entities remediate the problem or deficiency, fantastic",
          "## Conclusion\n\nI’ll end with this: in a perfect world, we wouldn’t need a Division of Enforcement because we wouldn’t have violations of our securities laws",
          "But we do not live in a perfect world",
          "And so long as it does, I am honored to help steer the ship – using the guiding principles I have described, and with careful and thoughtful stewardship of the formidable resources and power the federal government has entrusted to me – on behalf of those that rely on and participate in our capital markets",
          "Thank you for your time and attention",
          "I look forward to the discussion to follow"

        "full_text": "Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Waters, and Members of the Committee: It is an honor to testify before you today. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the work of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.[[1]](#_ftn1) Nine months ago, I returned to the SEC with a clear mandate to recommit the agency to our core mission of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. I am grateful to work alongside dedicated public servants who have hit the ground running in pursuit of these priorities. America’s $124.3 trillion capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world, leading both in market capitalization and trading volume. They are a marvel of human ingenuity. Yet over the years, the federal government’s natural tendency has asserted itself, and rules have multiplied faster than the problems that they were intended to solve. This Congress and the Trump Administration are focused on bringing down the cost of living for the American people, and the SEC has a vital role to play. For example, public companies spend $2.7 billion a year to file their annual reports. This is $2.7 billion that companies are not reinvesting in their businesses to create jobs. $2.7 billion that our disclosure regime is diverting from your constituents to corporate lawyers, accountants, and consultants. Now, this is not to say that we want to gut corporate disclosure, which is vital. But we must modernize, rationalize, and streamline reports so that they are meaningful, understandable, and not a repellant to investors. After all, how many of you would read through an annual filing that rivals *War and Peace*? Disclosure documents of that length can do more to obscure than to illuminate. As I have stated previously, regulation ideally should be smart, effective, and appropriately tailored within the confines of our statutory authority. Instead, it has made the path to public ownership narrower, costlier, and saddled with rules that can create more friction than benefit. For context, shortly after I left the SEC in the mid-1990s, there were more than 7,800 companies listed on the U.S. exchanges. By the time that I returned as Chairman, that figure had fallen by roughly 40 percent.[[2]](#_ftn2) This trajectory tells a cautionary tale of regulatory creep that the SEC is working to rectify through the three pillars of my plan to make IPOs great again: first, re-anchoring disclosures in materiality so that investment decisions can turn on economic signals rather than on regulatory noise; second, de-politicizing shareholder meetings by restoring their focus to significant corporate matters; and third, allowing public companies to have litigation alternatives so that we shield innovators from the frivolous and investors from the fraudulent. I also applaud the bipartisan initiatives that you are considering in Congress, including those in the Senate’s Empowering Main Street in America Act and the House’s INVEST Act, to help keep America’s capital markets open, dynamic, and, above all, worthy of the trust that investors place in them. Of course, I also support congressional efforts to enact the CLARITY Act. Upon its passage, the Commission stands ready to implement this landmark legislation. A federal framework for crypto markets is long overdue. Under Commissioner Hester Peirce’s leadership of our Crypto Task Force, SEC staff has provided more clarity in the past year than in the prior decade, but there is no action we can take that future-proofs our rulebook more formidably than nonpartisan market structure legislation. As Congress completes its vital work, CFTC Chairman Mike Selig and I intend to provide a bridge toward legislation. Through our now-joint Project Crypto, we will consider a token taxonomy to offer both investors and innovators a clear understanding of their regulatory obligations. We will also look to consider exemptions that would allow market participants to move and transact on-chain. Now, as we modernize oversight for digital assets, we must also reassess whether our legacy tools for traditional markets remain appropriately aligned with regulatory need and the public interest, which brings me to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). I have directed SEC staff to conduct a comprehensive review of the CAT, which will consider, among other things, issues related to governance, funding, potential cost-savings measures (including potential retirement of duplicative systems), design, functionality, scope, regulatory use, and security. As the staff undertake this review, I note that the Commission has already taken steps to meaningfully reduce the costs of the CAT system which, when established in November 2016, estimated to total, at the upper end, about $55 million annually. Thanks in part to an amendment to the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission in 2024 and conditional exemptive relief issued by the Commission in 2025, we have reduced the originally-approved CAT budget for 2025—which included approximately $249 million in annual operating costs—by approximately $92 million over the course of the year. The Commission has also recently approved amendments to the CAT NMS Plan with respect to the Customer and Account Information System that self-regulatory organizations (SROs) state would result in an approximately $7-9 million in cost savings annually. In addition, the SROs recently proposed further amendments to the CAT NMS Plan to implement certain measures that would further reduce costs significantly. Those cost reductions reflect the SEC’s broader commitment to disciplined oversight across our regulatory ecosystem. In January 2026, for example, the SEC approved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) budget, totaling $362.1 million—a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year, including a 52 percent and 42 percent reduction in the Chairman’s and other Board members’ compensation, respectively. As the SEC and the PCAOB often work closely on matters important to our capital markets, I am also pleased that the Commission recently appointed new Board members who bring a wide variety of experiences to their service. When we began the search process, I highlighted the role that the PCAOB plays in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public companies through oversight of auditing firms, and thus the broader public markets, in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies and broker-dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB’s budget. The newly appointed Chairman and Board Members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service. The Chairman has extensive experience in management of a large organization and examinations work. I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB—one of sensible, more effective, and more efficient oversight of auditors. Finally, and most fundamentally, capital markets thrive on many factors, but they endure on the trust of those who participate in them. Investor protection is at the core of what brings us to work each day. And to fulfill that charge, the SEC is returning its enforcement program to first principles of rooting out fraud and remedying investor harm. Since I rejoined the Commission last year, we have brought enforcement actions to address offering frauds, insider trading, accounting and financial frauds, and breaches of fiduciary duty by investment advisers. In the fall, meanwhile, we announced the Division of Enforcement’s Cross-Border Task Force to strengthen and enhance our efforts to identify and combat cross-border fraud. Since September, we have suspended trading in the stocks of fourteen Asia-based issuers on evidence of potential manipulation designed to artificially inflate the price and volume of the securities. I am working within the securities laws to protect investors from those who seek to use international borders to evade and undermine U.S. investor protections. Markets are global. Investor protection must be as well. As I said at the outset of this testimony, the SEC is returning to a core mission that remains as vital today as it was when Congress first set it for us over 90 years ago. So, I want to thank this Committee once again for convening today’s hearing. I look forward to answering your questions and to our shared work ahead. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n[[1]](#_ftn1) The views expressed in this testimony are those of the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and do not necessarily represent the views of the President, the full Commission, or any Commissioner.\n\n[[2]](#_ftn2) As of September 30, 2025, there were 4,761 exchange-listed companies.",

          "Under Commissioner Hester Peirce’s leadership of our Crypto Task Force, SEC staff has provided more clarity in the past year than in the prior decade, but there is no action we can take that future-proofs our rulebook more formidably than nonpartisan market structure legislation",
          "As Congress completes its vital work, CFTC Chairman Mike Selig and I intend to provide a bridge toward legislation",
          "Through our now-joint Project Crypto, we will consider a token taxonomy to offer both investors and innovators a clear understanding of their regulatory obligations",
          "We will also look to consider exemptions that would allow market participants to move and transact on-chain",
          "Now, as we modernize oversight for digital assets, we must also reassess whether our legacy tools for traditional markets remain appropriately aligned with regulatory need and the public interest, which brings me to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT)",
          "I have directed SEC staff to conduct a comprehensive review of the CAT, which will consider, among other things, issues related to governance, funding, potential cost-savings measures (including potential retirement of duplicative systems), design, functionality, scope, regulatory use, and security",
          "As the staff undertake this review, I note that the Commission has already taken steps to meaningfully reduce the costs of the CAT system which, when established in November 2016, estimated to total, at the upper end, about $55 million annually",
          "Thanks in part to an amendment to the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission in 2024 and conditional exemptive relief issued by the Commission in 2025, we have reduced the originally-approved CAT budget for 2025—which included approximately $249 million in annual operating costs—by approximately $92 million over the course of the year",
          "The Commission has also recently approved amendments to the CAT NMS Plan with respect to the Customer and Account Information System that self-regulatory organizations (SROs) state would result in an approximately $7-9 million in cost savings annually",
          "In addition, the SROs recently proposed further amendments to the CAT NMS Plan to implement certain measures that would further reduce costs significantly",
          "Those cost reductions reflect the SEC’s broader commitment to disciplined oversight across our regulatory ecosystem",
          "In January 2026, for example, the SEC approved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) budget, totaling $362.1 million—a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year, including a 52 percent and 42 percent reduction in the Chairman’s and other Board members’ compensation, respectively",
          "As the SEC and the PCAOB often work closely on matters important to our capital markets, I am also pleased that the Commission recently appointed new Board members who bring a wide variety of experiences to their service",
          "When we began the search process, I highlighted the role that the PCAOB plays in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public companies through oversight of auditing firms, and thus the broader public markets, in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies and broker-dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB’s budget",
          "The newly appointed Chairman and Board Members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service",
          "The Chairman has extensive experience in management of a large organization and examinations work",
          "I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB—one of sensible, more effective, and more efficient oversight of auditors",
          "Finally, and most fundamentally, capital markets thrive on many factors, but they endure on the trust of those who participate in them",
          "Investor protection is at the core of what brings us to work each day",
          "And to fulfill that charge, the SEC is returning its enforcement program to first principles of rooting out fraud and remedying investor harm",
          "Since I rejoined the Commission last year, we have brought enforcement actions to address offering frauds, insider trading, accounting and financial frauds, and breaches of fiduciary duty by investment advisers",
          "In the fall, meanwhile, we announced the Division of Enforcement’s Cross-Border Task Force to strengthen and enhance our efforts to identify and combat cross-border fraud",
          "Since September, we have suspended trading in the stocks of fourteen Asia-based issuers on evidence of potential manipulation designed to artificially inflate the price and volume of the securities",
          "I am working within the securities laws to protect investors from those who seek to use international borders to evade and undermine U.S",
          "Investor protection must be as well",
          "As I said at the outset of this testimony, the SEC is returning to a core mission that remains as vital today as it was when Congress first set it for us over 90 years ago",
          "So, I want to thank this Committee once again for convening today’s hearing",
          "I look forward to answering your questions and to our shared work ahead",
